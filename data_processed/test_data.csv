"hey guys

well what a banger way to end the play ins even though the reverse sweep killed my crystal ball again  

 no mountain soul out of the 9 games played today which is kinda wild however all the drags are close with cloud slightly ahead 
 kaisa pulled 5 clear of xayah on most picked as well as picking up some needed wins to bring her winrate up to 50
 maokai and orianna are the most banned of playins with 21 each though they are not that far ahead
 we know have 5 champs played in multiple roles those being rell sett poppy taliyah and maokai will we have someone in 3 or is 2 going to be the correct answer
 most deaths is pretty tight with only 20 deaths separating 1st and 9th
 beanj moves clear in first bloods with 4 crownie is currently on 3 with labrov and sheo on 1 each have to see how well they do in swiss
 crownie also took the lead for most kills in a game with 13 this would have been enough for 3rd last year
 we now have 2 categories with results as gam is now the team that advanced the furthest from a 2 or less team region 
 we also now have a reverse sweep so rip me and everyone who predicted 0 there was 1 last year so maybe i shoulda learnt
 no baron steals the whole of play ins wild im hoping we see a lot of steal in swiss d
 lastly its not a crystal ball thing but we have currently seen 58164 champs in champ select so either picked or banned where will we end up

thanks for a great play ins guys im looking forward to covering swiss and hope my crystal ball can be saved cos its not looking good d 

ive also added my pick ems for swiss just so yall can see them

"at first i thought if youre a good player when you dealt more total damage to the enemies but i saw some dudes just rushes to the enemies alone and die first they still dealt a lot of damage but it didnt help the team at all in my opinion

then i think its kda but some dudes literally just ks the whole game and stay behind the team so it isnt it

the final thing that i think is most reasonable is the score like s a b c d but im not sure since the scoring is incredibly strict somtimes i think i did really well in a match but the game still scored me a b max

so what do you think how to know if someones a good player",Bad Teammates
"are these options new i dont check the sound settings often so i dont know if thats always been there but im pretty sure this notification at the beginning of the round is new and as far as i know league doesnt have custom announcers the announcer was the same i think but there was a cheering sound every time someone was killed i kind of just assumed that was a draven thing though

also sorry for the photos i cant take screenshots of league for some reason

i managed to gain an absurd 70 cs lead in toplane very early on but then ended up spending the rest of the game trying to slow down the enemy teams insane momentum instead of using that lead to give us an advantage the enemys macro was so much better than my team for obvious reasons and the result of that game was clearly up to them they only lose if they troll

i understand that they say 30 of your games are unwinnable but this should not be the case because theyve put you against smurfs it should be because your team is playing badly in a fair match

"i really dont see the point in the adjustments now that riot are backtracking themselves on some of them shes a viable carry pick can have proplay presence in the right conditions and she fills a niche for players in soloqueue that is largely under represented in carry roles while also having that diet mageenchanter gameplay thats popular at support

and since original changes were announced and all three spheres of supp bot and mid sera players have reacted with large amounts of negativity on top of the community around them reacting negatively to the changes

why ship them at all its clearly something that both mains and players do not want for the champion its not to late too just leave it alone

"anybody piloting this champion with both hands can take over the entire game

she has three modifiers in aram including 5 damage dealt 5 damage taken and 30  healing this is compounded by her passive which increases healing by up to 50 based on missing health and further boosted by spirit visage or revitalise

 i understand that the majority of players will kill themselves due to berserk but later in the game unless your team has infinite cc to stop her w and enough burst to kill her in between es both of which heal her for a ridiculous amount it becomes comically difficult for her to die so long as shes pressing buttons in the general direction of the enemy team 

all she needs is goredrinker and spirit visage and she only gets more unkillable with each item she wont kill you instantly but my god is this champion sticky and insufferable even healing reduction feels useless against all of her healing amplifiers",Bad Teammates

they post tier list contents every patch although their contents are based on kr server it sure is very useful

champion tiers are determined based on data from the kr server tiers emerald and above

the criteria for selecting champion tiers is based on the champion pick rate win rate ban rate counter rate and data in high elo rank comprehensively a pick rate of over 05 is required to be in the tier list  


httpslolpsstatisticshttpspreviewreddit7pbtgwwh9wub1jpgwidth1920ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps57500be91d60a6aeab1841803447e227be8c642f

lets start at top if you look at the tier 1 lineup youll be taken aback

aatrox darius fiora yone jax all five champions are tricky to play against well only be able to ban one of them and id probably ban aatrox

obviously the champion that top players have been talking about a lot lately would be yone jax and his friends

aatrox has a 137 pick rate and a 504 win rate looking like a safe first pick champ and able to take the initiative easily compared to the last patch hes lost a bit of momentum what weve expected for top this patch is that champions will decline due to nerfs such as conqueror and grasp of the undyingbased champions are going to have a chance and he wasnt able to get out of the woods 100 hes still a good first pick champ but not a freeforall pick

we mentioned that grasp of the undyingbased champions got a chance this patch a prime example is fiora with a 7 pick rate and a 508 win rate she made it into tier 1 weve seen some improvements in her power curve where her firstcore timing which was a bit elusive has been improved its also a good enough card against aatrox yone and jax

if you go higher up in rank only darius gets down from tier 1 and rumble seems to be taking over so its like the top players preferences are almost somewhat the same however rumble is a difficult pick to use properly unless youre in master tier or higher

on the other hand jaxs data is yet again going astray the changes to the motions this patch have made him smoother to deal damage and weve seen tiers rise despite a bug that will eventually hurt him at tiers emerald and above we arent sure if the win rate changes based on proficiency and its not until you get to tiers master and above that the pick rate is 163 and the win rate is 512 at the end of the day we dont think jaxs tier went up because his damage increased or because his durability got too good but instead we think its more of an increase in convenience than anything else so we think its fair to say that its only going to rate well for more skilled players but like we said beforehand its also a patch version that champions using grasp of the undying have a chance at so jax is a good pick right now

jungle this is the position that really got sniped this patch and heres tier 1 with a total of five champs graves lee sin karthus rammus nidalee 

graves is on a roll right now up 11 spots to the top rankings if ad junglers know when to utilize dorans blade and this becomes more widespread we may be able to see a more interesting power balance between junglers for now graves is showing off selfish stats and as of today hes got close to a 25 pick rate and his ban rate is quickly exceeding 20  and yet his win rate is creeping upwards to the point where it negates this disastrous pick rate increase the youmuus buff this patch has really helped graves and the changes to the jungle as a whole didnt really impact graves at all so hes relatively more powerful than before 

champions like graves karthus and nidalee who dont get affected as hard by the jungling changes or even briar and ivern at the top of tier 2 are in a relatively better situation in the case of ivern his pick rate is actually still low at 18 but his win rate is still in the 54 range on the other hand as we pointed out at top the late game value is good 

champs who struggled in solo queue due to weak jungling are getting another chance rammus has a 55 pick rate and a 535 win rate and maokai has a 71 pick rate and a 52 win rate these guys are prime examples instead you need to have really good late game value unless you have outstanding late game value youre still going to be held back by your jungling ability it has to be almost as strong as the power graph youre looking at right now with a late game win rate of over 55

sylas jungle is an interesting case we were wondering if it would no longer be a thing after this patch because jungling is so hard sylas jungle itself is still hard to play this patch but not unplayable we think hes defending his data as other champs have received more damage he has a 69 pick rate and a 496 win rate

for the mid lane weve also picked five tier 1 champs sylas orianna taliyah irelia akali

surprisingly akshan did get a nerf this patch and hes been on a downward spiral but its amazing that hes managed to stay on the edge of tier 1 hes truly a solo queue champion he has a 35 pick rate and a 524 win rate

well give the op mark to sylas he has a pick rate of 134 and a win rate of 505 and hes a champion who should be difficult to pick first but nevertheless hes also playing a lot of different runes so we think he needs to be lit up more well try to put together a sylas featurette video soon from runes to items and playstyles we bet you have a lot of questions

naafiri and neeko even though theyre in tier 2 are champions with very high win rates well keep it simple and just go over their performance stats naafiri has a 27 pick rate and a 536 win rate while neeko has a 25 pick rate and a 529 win rate the difference between the two is that naafiris pick rate has been increasing recently while neekos pick rate is going down but they are both good picks yone is in tier 2 with a 127 pick rate and a 485 win rate he has the second highest pick rate at mid after sylas

after the ad leblanc statikk shiv nerf the devs gave a nudge to go back to ap and they said the compensation patch at the time worked for leblanc on ap items so no additional buffs were needed immediately after the nerf we were told that the statikk shiv leblancs data was chipping away at her stats as a whole were really close to the ap build now and leblanc is still struggling with a 5 pick rate and 458 win rate moving up to tiers diamond and above he has a 45 pick rate and 473 win rate at master and above a 44 pick rate and 447 win rate and and bronze to platinum a 51 pick rate and 454 win rate yes leblanc is very difficult to use at any tier right now and shes still getting picked as the developers have said we wonder if theyll give us another leblanc buff

there are more honey champs than usual since its after a big patch well give ezreal an op mark 275 pick rate 515 win rate a dominant performance no matter how untrustworthy hes been at worlds no other adc is as good as ezreal in solo queue considering that the recentlygoneviral unlimited stacks full as jinx has a 294 pick rate and a 50 win rate you can see how ezreal is putting up right now

the viral champion jinx has made it to tier 1 as of today she has a 35 pick rate and her ban rate is approaching 20 the next patch will include a nerf to jinxs passive stack but regardless its fun and users will want to experience how dope it is so adc players might still lean towards jinx

the buffed ziggs is doing a great job at bot were still cautious about recommending ziggs mid but ziggs bot has definitely become a viable joker pick hes got a 35 pick rate and a 537 win rate and as of today hes even gone above the 5 pick rate maybe without the turret plate gold nerf he ziggs bot meta might have been fully established its still pretty good as it is though hes got to the point where theres no bot champion with a win rate disadvantage

one champion to watch is armor pen miss fortune who is seeing a resurgence with the youmuus buff her pick rate is slightly up from the previous patch but she doesnt seem to be getting much attention the value of miss fortune leading to youmuuscollector seems pretty good so you might want to give it a try

the usual suspects blitz rakan thresh and nautilus are in tier 1 we arent going to give out a bunch of op marks though theyre showing good but not great performances maybe its a different kind of balance 

senna deserves the spotlight shes stepped up once more with a 99 pick rate and 517 win rate she has good lategame value and shes a champion who can adopt items like umbral glaive and youmuus so we think the potential is higher as of today shes already over a 10 pick rate so we think its safe to say shes practically tier 1

maokai who has higher lategame potential than senna has also had a higher pick rate recently he has a 2 pick rate and a 535 win rate so you should consider him morgana got patched and morgana jungle has been getting a lot of attention so her pick rate as support has also increased quite a bit there was a significant increase in her data with a pick rate of 47 and a win rate of 493 however its not a perfect match for the current meta so it has some limitations

"while griefing sure as shit isnt acceptable its kind of wild how often ill see an adc saying basic things like plz stop using puddle in tower or please get pressure so i can farm only to immediately be yelled at by the entire team to just mute as though muting solves play issues or some variation of adcs always toxic fucking report

only for those players to turn around at 35 minutes and demand their underfarmed chaindove adc fucking help or some variation of whining at them whether the adc has given up or is just weak ultimately isnt super relevant it just strikes me as wild that it seems to be commonplace for players to believe everyone should shut up and say nothing until it impacts them personally

"i want to know if someone else consistently experiences this

ampx200b

i will have games where my attacks carve through anything and everything and i will have games were it takes 6 auto attacks to kill a minion this happens in downrank games where league forces a loss on you in order to keep you at a 50 winrate in uprank games at the same game time items and level i will 2 hit the same minion the same applies to champions my most recent experience was a cait vs tristana game where i would hit her with 6 auto attacks and she left with 95 hp while she hit me 2 times and i walked away with lt25 hp this was early game so there was no meaningful difference in abilities or items no traps or nets were used in this engagement only auto attacks

everyone keeps calling it a skill issue because its a toxic community but when dumping 1400 damage into an adc with miss fortunes ultimate hitting the whole thing and the adc walking away with most of its hp it is hardly a skill issue anymore in games with identical item sets levels and game times that kind of attack would completely kill the same adc i also want to stress that the times this has happened the adc in question always has less hp at the time than the total damage dealt by the ultimate

ampx200b

the same thing also happens when playing master yi where randomly my attacks will do 5x as much damage as normal and some games they do practically nothing i have looked into every single stat i can think of from armor magic resist life steal weird items runes dragon buffs etc no matter how much i look i see no meaningful difference in characters builds or all of the above that would explain these experiences i hope that some of you have gone through something similar so i can finally figure this out

ampx200b

finally i wish to note this applies to everyone in my lobby we are a 3 stack and we all consistently experience this difference in damage output and enemy damage negation always at the same time in the same matches i assume many more out there have this issue and it is being attributed to a skill issue despite no change in playstyle nor build on either team

edit  
dont bother commenting if you have not experienced it if you have nothing to add you are just taking up space the reason for this is that this thread is not about people screaming at eachother but rather to see if it is a widespread issue if toxic people spam toxic comments it will drown out the meaningful content i addressed the usual responses above so no comments repeating the same thing are needed as the point have been made alredy

this is not about getting a rank its about consistent gameplay even in blind pick

i want to stress as its been mentioned in the comments i am not talking about  losers queue i have not heard the term used before but from what i read it is about pairing you with bad teammates i am talking about actual debuffs like doing less damage luxs q having a smaller hitbox in some games compared to others and players generally taking less damage from attacks this is not a post about bad teammates but a post about game mechanics",Bad Teammates

"im sure most people have seen it by now from the countless clips uploaded to highlight channels but jinx is blatantly overpowered right now from the buffs this patch that allow her to chain her passive where she gets more than 10 as and allow you to instantly finish the game if youre close to the enemy nexus shes currently 51 winrate with a 25 pickrate that rivals kaisa riot nerfed sett before for the same reason that occasionally he built the mathematically correct sett build allowing you to os people with his w this is the same situation

caitlyn is in the same boat  dont judge her winrate by the crit build but if you switch to lethality build her winrate shoots up to 57 with a very significant amount of matches she essentially stacks lethality becoming a menace as a lanebully and when she hits 3 items she becomes an ult bot which combined with first strike and axiom arc allows her to snowball gold just by pressing one button her ultimate can literally one shot any nontank in the game i dont think thats okay and it makes for a pretty boring playstyle in the botlane

"hi all

so im writing this in the hopes riot will consider implementing so additional information regarding how effective items are currently most items show how much additional healing shielding damage etc they are giving and in some cases spirit visage eclipse divine sunderer we can see multiple types of benefits

currently there are a few missing that i think would be good to see most notably the new adc mythics are all lacking information as to their additional damage output

infinity edge additional crit damage

navori quickblades additional crit damage and cd reduction

bloodthirster additional damage and healing done

collector number of executes and gold

lord dominics additional damage through  pen 

voidstaff through additional pen

rylais crystal scepter time slowed sec

cosmic drive movement speed active sec

riftmaker healing done

shieldbow healing done

blade of the ruined king healing done

ravenous hydra healing done

mortal reminder damage from  pen

guinsoos rageblade on hit damage done additional on hit damage done for other items producing off this and additional damage done from pen

seryldas grudge additional damage from pen and time slowed sec

divine sunderer additional damage from pen

plated steel caps damage reduced from auto attacks

eclipse additional damage from pen

runaans hurricane additional damage from on hit damage and additional damage from on hit damage from other items

i feel adding these would give players a lot more clarity on what their items are actually doing ingame as the many already showing these details do

i would also suggest adding additional damage from flat pen items like sorcerer boots and lethality items

im interested if others would like to see this information let me know your thoughts

you can use black shield to make sure the enemy cant use cc as a means of escape

but they keep missing the damn mark man like wtf are they doing  
  
how to make morgana jungle epic    
  
1 her ult needs to give a shield based on how many people she ulted something like  69169269 per person she ulted remove the movespeed since morgana will buy rylais anyway  morg jungle has smite
2 increase the duration of q versus jungle mobs by 69  
3 increase her base model size by 69 to allow for better intimidation tactis  
4 nerf dianas model by reducing her thigh size  
5 increase the duration of q versus jungle mobs by 069  
6 increase her base ad to 69  
7 for an anti mage mage her magic resist caps at 52ish by lvl 18 change her per level to 23 instead this will give her 69 mr by rank 18  
8 the damage of w against jungle mobs needs to be 16969

so lets say im 70 destroyed my lane but lets say another couple of lanes on my team have hard lost standard scenario i know im in a position to carry the game im turning up and pinging objectives knowing crucial team fights are likely to break out my insert front line top laner or jungler here are watching the enemy team take drakebaron theyre moving back and fourth with no purpose im pinging assistance inside the drake pit to tell them to go in it literally doesnt matter if they die i know with my superior positioning mechanics and gold advantage i can win us the team fight and objective all the while im waiting safely around the corner waiting to twitch q my way into the fight once its begun and crucial cc abilities from the enemy are used

but no my front liner doesnt want to go in instead watches them take the objective front row cinema ticket before the enemy team collapse onto my front liner and just explode him before i can even help by this point nobody else is even around bc theyve run away after seeing the objective has been taken its either a 5v2 with my front liner which i really dont wanna do no matter how fed i am and the bounty i have or we just never get to fight

im a high ping player myself i based my opinions on how they playable they are from a 90300 constant ping range incase you want to know i myself play on170 ping constant and no packet loss now firstly i think i should explain what i think makes a champ good on high ping there are 5 main things that are challening on high ping in no order  last hitting minionscsing dodging skill shots hitting skill shots executing combos and early game as a whole 

now immediately you may ask why champs like lux who are quite skill shots reliant are in the higher tier the main reason is that they make it up heavily in other categories so looking at luxvexannivianeeko and veigar they all have  extremely good wave clear andor an easier time csing they also arent interactive during the laning phase which means they dont really have worry about landingdodge skill shots as much these champs also have cc that which maybe on a skill shotbut if they do land it they dont have to worry about any of there other upcoming abilities since it a stationary target which is alot better than having to poke trade on a constantly moving target 

in reality though most league players will never get to a rank where high ping  100200 range  makes the game impossible since its may not exist just look at somone like flyerbekk who managed kata on high ping azzapp who got to chall on velkoz so just play what you enjoy and if you want to give yourself the best chance then you still have the freedom to do that thanks ",Bad Teammates

"teleport is basically does the exact thing on mid lane that it did on top lane before unleashed teleport was introduced 

adressing teleport for the early game should have happened last patch when death timers changed but they didnt change the tp mechanic for early game 

its the same top lane situation you are not getting punished for being solokilled early levels but ot rather gives you a favor you can die and tp back to mid lane on a good wave state and get the goldfreeze in this form if you pick ignite for mid you are trolling 

this type of gameplay design favors mages which i would hav nothing against as a mage player but it honestly feels unfair and removes the fun element of playing mid lane the excitement and the challenge 

surely if you go smurf into irongold this wont be as problematic but if you play high enough you will understand how this is the same scenario before unleashed tp as top laners just died winner pushed lane while the 010 guy just used tp to get back to lane and set up a permanent freeze

2 for normal non challenger players its already a lot to ask to develope an intuition for jinx attack speed for 1 the minigun 2 the rockes 3 minigun with passive 4 rockets with passive now there are so many different high attack speeds that normal people should just stand still and not kite because they will cancel too many autos to make it worth it old jinx with rockets and passive was the easiest most noob friendly version of adc kiting and given that she is the face of league of legends to most people checking out the game i think that is a good thing just buff her base numbers and revert her please

so here is my suggestion  if ___ player has x amount of deaths before x amount of minutes they are not allowed to vote on surrender now the number of deaths and time could be determined by the player base and  or dev team maybe using data they have on people banned for inting this formula could also potentially be used for afk  nonparticipation  ___player has x amount of cs before x minutes it can be assumed they are not participating   


to add to this if a player is removed from voting anyone in their party is also unable to vote this will cut down on people holding surrender votes hostage  


again this could be totally the wrong way to do this but id like to see something done about inting ive been playing league for 10 years now and i really dont like wasting 3040 minutes because 2 people refuse to surrender after intentionally feeding

its a free deployed build and quite rushed it started off as a simple console script that i probably shouldnt have made into a webapp but here we are please ignore any defects and it surely could have had more features but for now it has two modes to play

1 randomize results
   1 randomize east biased in this mode the next round is generated but east always wins vs west and g2 always wins vs west
   2 randomize completely random complete chaos
2 pickem at any round you are free to click and select on the outcomes for matches and lock in after you select your picks

i searched for what the ruleshttpslolfandomcomwikiarchiveofficial_rulebooksriotworlds2023 would be for teams to draw into matches in the following rounds but saw that there are no additional rules so it is supposedly random

"ive had this happen to me at least 5 times this week where i pick my champion i see my matchup and i start editing my runes and then when i try to save or exit the editor runes could not be saved shows up and it defaults you to your first recommended rune page and the game launches

its not predictable and it ruins the game

without certain runes vs some matchups the lane is not playable at all and losing to game client instead of my teammates or opponents is just adding salt to the wounds of soloq

"as 1320 and now 1321 patches have shown with the changes to morgana zyra and brand riot is trying to broaden the number of champs who are jungle viable even nerfing other parts of their kit slightly after the buffs required for jungle

i think that there is some lowhanging fruit that riot is missing out on and i was wondering what others people had champions who could jungle with minor tweaks feel different to play than current junglers and would be healthy for the game as a whole

chogath all he needs is an increase in his monster cap on his e at rank 1 the 3 max health damage caps at a measly 60 damage  which even slows down his first clear as the level 1 buffs have 23k health without the cap hed do 9 more damage per e  27 more damage per cast while the caps are really designed to prevent champs from taking down objectives too quick while chos ult is great during smite fights the more common tank build is actually really bad at taking down objectives quickly most of his damage comes from ult amp  health on his e

a change on his cap from 6020rank to maybe 10020stack would speed up his first couple clears to be semicompetitive still on the slow side and average at objectives nothing else in his kit would need to change

i think chogath jungle would be healthy for the game since while he has 3 ccs and an execute his lack of gapclosers or any movement keeps him from being too annoying to play against when 23 of his ccs and his execute are closerange and the third is telegraphed unlike if lissandra was made a viable jungler as phreak mentioned

"every day since the start of worlds mercedes gives away 500 chests in a daily raffle the webpage mentions that prizes would be distributed 72 hours after the completion of the playins so any winners should have recieved their prizes by now

i joined the raffle every day since the start of playins so those are 7 entries some days only a couple thousand people joined the raffle so i figured my chances of winning one were pretty high unfortunately i did not win anything

as the title says i am curious if anyone actually won a mercedes hextech chest in the daily raffle and if anyone won one what did you get out of the chest i wonder if they are any different compared to normal hextech or masterwork chests they look pretty neat at least

"first off morgana jungle makes way sense than support  
not only does her passive and w actually work together but have value and are useable  
you can use black shield to make sure the enemy cant use cc as a means of escape  
landing your q has even more value  
the increase gold income helps you alot to make your ult viable by buying the 3k gold item that allows you to use your ult in a teamfight  
  
but they keep missing the damn mark man like wtf are they doing  
  
how to make morgana jungle epic    
  
1 her ult needs to give a shield based on how many people she ulted something like  69169269 per person she ulted remove the movespeed since morgana will buy rylais anyway  morg jungle has smite
2 increase the duration of q versus jungle mobs by 69  
3 increase her base model size by 69 to allow for better intimidation tactis  
4 nerf dianas model by reducing her thigh size  
5 increase the duration of q versus jungle mobs by 069  
6 increase her base ad to 69  
7 for an anti mage mage her magic resist caps at 52ish by lvl 18 change her per level to 23 instead this will give her 69 mr by rank 18  
8 the damage of w against jungle mobs needs to be 16969
9 give her a voice line versus kayle i will chain you up with 69 chains and feed you to nafari you disgrace

"ive never seen the swiss format before so i decided to create a python script to simulate it i ran this simulation millions of times collecting data for analysis what ive found is quite interesting

a common narrative im hearing about swiss from people whove seen it in other esports is that if theres an upset things will get weird  

while its true its also missing something big the swiss stage does not need upsets to get weird

to prove this point i want to rank the teams and to remove my own bias we can use the outright betting odds from multiple sites and take the averages this is what it looks like



 rank  region  team  outright win odds 

 1     lpl     jdg   1445        
 2     lck     geng  4389        
 3     lpl     lng   5515        
 4     lck     t1    753         
 5     lpl     wbg   9083        
 6     lpl     blg   9333        
 7     lck     kt    1241        
 8     lck     dk    145         
 9     lec     g2    40553       
 10    lec     fnc   78333       
 11    lec     mad   88667       
 12    lcs     c9    98333       
 13    lcs     nrg   177777      
 14    lcs     tl    252777      
 15    lec     bds   275          
 16    vcs     gam   444444      

thankfully region distribution works out neatly the top 8 teams are from the lck and lpl and theres a bit of a gulf between dk rank 8 and g2 rank 9

lets define an upset as any rank 916 team beating a rank 1 to 8 team which is the same as saying an upset is an leclcsvcs team beating a lcklpl team

i ran the simulation while setting the chance of upsets to 0 and gave regions win rates heres a chart of it

 region 1  region 2  region 1 wr 

 lck       lck       50             
 lck       lpl       50             
 lck       lcs       100            
 lck       lec       100            
 lck       vcs       100            
 lpl       lpl       50             
 lpl       lcs       100            
 lpl       lec       100            
 lpl       vcs       100            
 lcs       lcs       50             
 lcs       lec       50             
 lcs       vcs       50             
 lec       lec       50             
 lec       vcs       50             
 vcs       vcs       50             
 vcs       pi        50             


to summarise the chart if a 1 to 8th ranked team is playing a 9 to 16th ranked team they have a 100 win rate every other matchup is a 50 win rate 

now this is where things get juicy

i ran the simulation 100k times and these are the results

 teams advancing  nonlcklpl 

 0                37814       
 1                60756       
 2                1429        
 3                1           
 4                0           


without ever beating an lck or lpl team 1 or more leclcsvcs teams advance in 62 of simulations

the real clever ones reading this probably have also realised that for this to be true lpllck teams will be going home without ever losing to anyone but lpllck teams

pretty cool for the west right bare in mind these stats above are an absolute minimum as clearly the western teams will have a better win rate against lpllck teams than 0 surely

if we compare swiss with the old groups format using the same seeding pools youll see how much better this format is for us 

with the old format using the same winrate method as above not a single leclcsvcs team will ever advance to quarters this is because each group will have an lck team and an lpl team and they will get 4 wins plus meanwhile this means the other 2 teams lose 4 each at a minimum

due to the increased randomness of swiss over the old groups stage and to the detriment of getting the true best 8 teams into the finals the west is definitely happy here should we feel bad that its very likely an lck  lpl team will drop out of the tournament by losing only to lck  lpl teams probably but hey it will be nice to win for once

i have more data using dummy team by team win rates trying to simulate closer to what will happen i got to these win rates by working backwards from the outright winning odds and trial and error with win rates until the output matched the outright perhaps ill go in depth of it thats for another post though here are some interesting things i learned bare in mind the accuracy relies on the quality of the input and its impossible to know the true odds before teams play

1 in swiss the average rank difference between teams in games is smaller than groups by approximately 11 meaning we get more competitive matches groups has far more completely one sided matchups

2 over 72 of scenarios had 2 or more leclcsvcs teams advancing

3  only 13 of scenarios had 0 leclcsvcs teams advancing so 987 had at least 1",Champion Design

2 for normal non challenger players its already a lot to ask to develope an intuition for jinx attack speed for 1 the minigun 2 the rockes 3 minigun with passive 4 rockets with passive now there are so many different high attack speeds that normal people should just stand still and not kite because they will cancel too many autos to make it worth it old jinx with rockets and passive was the easiest most noob friendly version of adc kiting and given that she is the face of league of legends to most people checking out the game i think that is a good thing just buff her base numbers and revert her please

i had this impression since the skin was released and now that its is back at the shop i remembered it it really feels that drx aatrox took some inspirations from omegas design which i think is great because megaman zero doesnt get much recognizition despite being an amazing series

aside from stories contexts and other nuances both are giant dudes with big swords scarred by war who scream all the time and only seek the destruction of everything

the resemblance is lost with the prestige version and im aware this may be a huge coincidence and if it is its still great a champ that i like to play has a skin that strongly resembles an antagonist of a game series i love and thats all i need

"i get that if a specific rune is broken it should be nerfed because all runes should be about equal but its weird to me that they wanted to nerf most runes lategame see patch notes they nerfed scaling on a bunch of runes

the argument is that the runes should be less impactful than the items and what not and that was already true but nerfing runes across the board is just so weird to me because its like the one thing that league has unique that most other mobas do not and then they want to make it less impactful also kind of takes a little bit of playstyle diversity away from champs because with runes you can make a different build  playstyle viable

next step just remove runes and then just remove all abilities and then give all champs the same stats so we can just do minion brawls playing as minions please

"i want to know if someone else consistently experiences this

ampx200b

i will have games where my attacks carve through anything and everything and i will have games were it takes 6 auto attacks to kill a minion this happens in downrank games where league forces a loss on you in order to keep you at a 50 winrate in uprank games at the same game time items and level i will 2 hit the same minion the same applies to champions my most recent experience was a cait vs tristana game where i would hit her with 6 auto attacks and she left with 95 hp while she hit me 2 times and i walked away with lt25 hp this was early game so there was no meaningful difference in abilities or items no traps or nets were used in this engagement only auto attacks

everyone keeps calling it a skill issue because its a toxic community but when dumping 1400 damage into an adc with miss fortunes ultimate hitting the whole thing and the adc walking away with most of its hp it is hardly a skill issue anymore in games with identical item sets levels and game times that kind of attack would completely kill the same adc i also want to stress that the times this has happened the adc in question always has less hp at the time than the total damage dealt by the ultimate

ampx200b

the same thing also happens when playing master yi where randomly my attacks will do 5x as much damage as normal and some games they do practically nothing i have looked into every single stat i can think of from armor magic resist life steal weird items runes dragon buffs etc no matter how much i look i see no meaningful difference in characters builds or all of the above that would explain these experiences i hope that some of you have gone through something similar so i can finally figure this out

ampx200b

finally i wish to note this applies to everyone in my lobby we are a 3 stack and we all consistently experience this difference in damage output and enemy damage negation always at the same time in the same matches i assume many more out there have this issue and it is being attributed to a skill issue despite no change in playstyle nor build on either team

edit  
dont bother commenting if you have not experienced it if you have nothing to add you are just taking up space the reason for this is that this thread is not about people screaming at eachother but rather to see if it is a widespread issue if toxic people spam toxic comments it will drown out the meaningful content i addressed the usual responses above so no comments repeating the same thing are needed as the point have been made alredy

this is not about getting a rank its about consistent gameplay even in blind pick

i want to stress as its been mentioned in the comments i am not talking about  losers queue i have not heard the term used before but from what i read it is about pairing you with bad teammates i am talking about actual debuffs like doing less damage luxs q having a smaller hitbox in some games compared to others and players generally taking less damage from attacks this is not a post about bad teammates but a post about game mechanics",Bad Teammates
" hextech gunblade was in the game for 10 years i honestly never heard the community complain about it occasionally some would say it made katakali oppressive but those champs were top tier for years after the item was removed anyway compare it to complaints from stopwatch banner of command hullbreaker stridbreakerdash active etc it was never an item anyone truly had an issue with it was actually a lot of fun people loved it everyone did

arguments against

1 but it acutally will make katakali oppressive  shut up who cares figure out how to deal with it
2 but it gives champs without cc cc and wiping away drool from chin champs with ccextra cc  so what shut up
3 sustain is not stammering s s supposed to be in thbe game anymore  so what shut up
4 it will loudly breathing and swallows saliva throw off the meta  the meta is boring and sucks anyway so what shut up
5 blah blah blah insert any argument against bringing gunblade back next patch  shut up

having an extra way to interact and make plays in the game via an item is 100x more fun than solely relying on your champs kit it allowed for more brainmode plays and it has plenty of counterplay still its not an auto win item think of all the screaming the lcs casters can do when somebody zap kills someone think of the pogchamps in lcs twitch chat

much of the sustain the game used to have has been removed or mitigated but i dont see how anyone can possibly find lack of sustainhealing fun it just means that you have to go back and forth from fountain far more often and are less able to make plays after a fight or duel zzzzzzzz the heal on the item wasnt overly op anyway it allowed you to gradually heal back to full health after 2 to 4 full minion waves depending on the point in the game and sustain a bit in lane example if kayle is vs malphite it allows kayle to somewhat persist in lane rather than permanently losing 13hp from one mindless malphite q and having to back or getting 1 shot ulted scoffs loudly ah ha hes a kayle player that explains why he wants it back1  shhhh be quiet

theres apparently a trend to pull away a bit from item actives wow thats so fun only playing in my little niche while another lane loses and having no agency or carry potential is not fun gunblade allows for more playmaking and opportunities to the champions that build it its a 3600 gold item so its something you have to work for as well

just bring it back if it truly messes stuff up then you can get rid of it again the game is the most straight up dead and boring grindfest its ever been the worst player in the game has too much agency and matchups have too little counterplay giving players an item that give people more opportunities and possibilities to carry is better for everyone better for me better for you yes you because everyone can build it me you your top your mid anyone that wants it im going to build one right now in my garage",Champion Design

support lux brand morgana zyra heim theyre all unfair and broken champions theyre supposed to be support poke you in lane yes but not make you recall every 2 seconds reduce the damages from champs who have poke kit in early game or reduce their stunsslows man legit you cant touch these guys reduce their turretsplants hp or something find the perfect balance youre the balancing team you dont even listen to your own communitys advices who are playing this game and firsthand experiencing all of this   
assasins duskblade axiom arc adios  
mages hmm yeah no only playable lateassgamescaling champs if the game doesnt end by then only 3 mages playable out of 100 azir syndra and orianna everything else is legit bad because of the items unusable everything too expensive and too niche  


ap items give you ap hp if lucky  
ad items give you ad ability haste hp armor reduction ms oh and hp again and might as well throw some armormr to that cuz why not

whats next few more new adc items or will it be support items cuz idk secondary role is just as important as your primary role

"passive gambling addiction

twisted fate is an serious gambler which causes him to play a game of book of raw every 5 minutes after every round twisted fate can win up to 100 gold or lose 100 gold the amount of won gold gets doubled every kill twisted fate has gained a death will result in losing the doubled amount

q tripledeck

twisted fate throws 3 cards at his opponents hit opponents get revealed and take critical magic damage after atleast hitting 2 opponents this spells cooldown will get a reset because why not killing a champ with doubledeck gives you permanent 5 armor resist for ad assassin abusers

w all in one

twisted fate crafts 3 cards to one causing the next auto attack to stun the opponent slowing the opponent for 3 seconds at a 99 rate after the stun while returning 10 from your maximum mana

while twisted fate gets in a 15 second crafting animation he gets 60 bonus resistances for extreme outplay potential

e 21 fatage

twisted fate is a huge 21 savage fan every 21st auto attack  every opponent on the map takes 100 magic damage scaling on 100 ap if the opponent dies of that effect twisted fate gets 21 gold 21 permanent movespeed and bascially 21 on every base stat 

r exodia

twisted fate proceeds to draw exodia off his deck becoming an absolute unit as his ult is active for 20 seconds he can teleport anywhere on the map for 3 times giving him 200 attack speed while his e effect is reduced to 7 cards",Champion Design

"given im a big numbers guy i made a spreadsheet to simulate the entirety of the worlds 2023 swiss stage about a week ago which i posted on githubhttpsgithubcomchiefdelphi7lol2023swisspredictions now that we have seen the worlds draw and the firstround matchups i wanted to dive a bit deeper into the draws impact who won who lost and how much firstround draws actually impact a teams chances of advancing through the tournament 



i already made a post describing the methodology of the simulation httpswwwredditcomrleagueoflegendscomments172emn0interactive_worlds_2023_swiss_stage_predictor but the crux of the rating system is that every team gets a power score that the user can adjust based on personal opinions and biases the probability team a beats team b is powerteam a  powerteam a  powerteam b its a simple system but its been shown to work reasonably well and quickly in practice in a number of contexts i tried to give what i thought was a fair assessment of teams relative powers east gt west gt minor regions higher seeds generally  higher power score but again if you can disagree you can adjust stuff yourself however nearly all of the conclusions i draw below are independent of the exact power values for each team all we care about is the order of teams and the strong east  west imbalance



if you saw the draft and agreed that generally east gt west you would come to the pretty obvious conclusion that c9 and mad were big winners kt and blg were big losers and the rest of the west were small losers for losing out on a chance to dodge the east the data generally supports this but the margins of impact are smaller than what i had expected

3 biggest absolute winners

1 c9 advancement odds 314 gt 353 39
2 gen advancement odds 906 gt 933 27
3 t1 advancement odds 850 gt 876  26

honorary mentions jdg 23 wbg 22 mad 20

however this is a tad biased against the west as were measuring odds improvement in absolute terms when most people think of improving the odds they think of improving odds relative to their original values ex twice as likely 


when you take this into account the biggest winners by relative odds improvement are

1 c9 1249 more likely to advance
2 mad 923 more likely to advance
3 wbg 326 more likely to advance


and in a similar vein the biggest losers are

1 gam 2897 less likely to advance
2 tl 1737 less likely to advance
3 bds 1674 less likely to advance

with honorary mentions to nrg 62 kt 503 and fnc 426




however i think these stats lose the forest for the trees look at gen and jdg for example they improve from 906 and 853 chance for advancement to 933 and 876 chance respectively their advancement odds dont improve much but their odds of not advancing drop substantially gen is 288 less likely to be knocked out in swiss t1 1735 jdg 1567 the single biggest impact of the draw is not that c9 or mad got a western first opponent its that gen t1 and jdg dodged eastern counterparts and got a far clearer path to 10 kt and blg werent so lucky and got hit with roughly 15 increases in their odds of getting knocked out relatively speaking as soon as it was determined that geng would play gam instead of say wbg we cut down on a whole lot of worlds where geng would go down 01 and worlds where gam would miraculously advance same holds for bds




so where does that leave eu and na frankly pretty much every region except vietnam is left with the same number of expected advancing teams as before just as before the draw we expected around 32 korean teams 3 chinese teams 11 eu teams 7 na teams and virtually 0 vietnamese teams to advance that hasnt noticeably changed with the draw at least up to 110th of an expected advancement to be honest thats kind of the theme with this draw we didnt get anything particularly crazy with matchups and no team comes out ahead or behind by any more than 4 advancement probability in absolute terms

i have to ask because i becoming insane now i play a lot of aram for years and i really feel that i dont do the dmg i should do the numbers written on my spell dont match the one that occurs like having a full crit senna my ad being 350 but every crit auto i land does only 200  not even on tanks i have a clip where i play darius i use my ultimate on a fizz and the little number who indicate how much i hit indicate that its being reduce by 150 it supposed to be true damage its the point of true damage not to be able to reduce them and thats on everyone i genuinely feels that my damage are incorrect i know im not that good at the game but when something hit it feels like it doesnt the opposite when i play tank i always fight against tank with 8k hp who are unkillable monster of tenacity and when i personnaly reach that kind of hp with ornn for example i being killed in 3 sec no tenacity even with mercury and the people im against dont have that kind of antitank build so i dont know for real,Bad Teammates
"disclaimer my goal is not to generate dramahate but rather to start a discussion im not the ultimate authority and i might not be the best player but im here to share my perspective

good evening gentlemen after playing this game since 2013 id like to share my opinion on why im not enjoying the current state of the game ive been playing inmaster as a support for quite some time now and ive noticed several things that bother me i wanted to get this off my chest and see if im the only one who thinks this way

1 jungle gt literally every game from d1 and above is solely dependent on the jungle its like a best jungle wins scenario in several games ive started an experiment of looking at the kda of both junglers at the end of the game and the winning team always has the jungler with better performance and its always a significant difference practically 90 of the games are like this basically the feeling you get is that when you queue up no matter what you do its best jung wins its like gambling hoping for a good jungle to be on your team as a support i try to secure objectives and make invades but if my jungler is not paying attention and doesnt read the game correctly whats the point of me playing well in the end league of legends has become a game where one person can carry the match and theres almost nothing i can do
2 adc gt currently its the most frustrating lane to play ive seen numerous games where a 143 adc loses the game and becomes irrelevant if you dont play perfectly you cant achieve much while a malphite who throws a tire and jumps into your face wins the game this used to be my main lane but as time went on playing adc became the worst possible experience not even when im winning i have fun most of your game is spent farming and praying to get three items to start making an impact while a oneitem aatrox is already a god moreover every month more champions with five dashes appear making your feeble flash and nothing essentially the same

tldr in high elo 90 of the games are decided by the best jungler and playing adc is currently the worst experience

what would i do i dont know im not a game designer riot is paid to solve this but they seem busy making skins for lux personally i wouldnt mind if they removed the jungle from the game",Bad Teammates
"i mean a scenario that occurs in like 40 of games your team wins a teamfight and gets to take 1 tower and 1 inhib and then you need to retreat since the enemy team respawns and probably kills you 

with this iteration of jinx even in the worse case where you lose your passive from the won teamfight before getting to destroy the first tower you get 1 stack from the first tower and 1 from inhib so you sit at 2 stacks you can now either take more towers  inhibs or if an enemy comes you just kill them basically jinx autowins those situations gaining 6 stacks easily its really not that rare anymore 


so my recommendation to balance the game increase gromps health by 400",Bad Teammates

"something i have noticed ever since the emerald rank was added into the pool of ranks was that my personal rank all of a sudden sky rocketed pretty fast compared to normal im not a super great player i pretty much end at gold 23 every season i have ended in plat 34 years ago like 2 times but as i get older im not as great and the play styles i use to like doing are not as viable anymore

that said as soon as the emerald tier was added i noticed i was shooting up rank super fast id go from gold 4 to 2 drop back down to gold 3 and then shoot to gold 1 literally skipping the ranks between and only have played like 78 matches for each jump i thought this was odd i typically sit at like a 5456 wr

then a few games later i was plat to my surprise but before emerald was added the difference between low plat and low gold had a different vibe typically but now i noticed they feel exactly the same and ive confirmed my suspicions because when ever games ar eover and i look at other peoples ranks im getting people between silver 3  plat 2

my theroy riot intentionally wanted people to feel like they are climbing faster or easier as a placebo effect to make people think they are getting better so they will continue to play the game and not feel as discouraged but in reality your actually not really improving because the quality of the mmr has been drastically dropped and you are still in the same mmr bracket

this is similar to how overwatch will count players who just hit an enemy once or twice as a kill for their kda to give them placebo effect of oh man im doing awesome i have 20 kills i feel the same has happen here with rank now",Bad Teammates

i had this impression since the skin was released and now that its is back at the shop i remembered it it really feels that drx aatrox took some inspirations from omegas design which i think is great because megaman zero doesnt get much recognizition despite being an amazing series

aside from stories contexts and other nuances both are giant dudes with big swords scarred by war who scream all the time and only seek the destruction of everything

the resemblance is lost with the prestige version and im aware this may be a huge coincidence and if it is its still great a champ that i like to play has a skin that strongly resembles an antagonist of a game series i love and thats all i need

btw if u dont want to be spoiled about megaman zero do not look up omega on google",Champion Design

 summary

 dorans items and dark seal overpowered corrupting is shit long sword  potions is shit if you are a jungler or a support get one after your first b riot will likely make them unique with your junglesupport item next patch
 jungle tank junglers are up while ap junglers are doing fine and most ad junglers are bad now riot should bring 68 bad scaling back for the jungle pet briar op and j4 are the 2 best ad junglers and j4 sits around 51
 items duskblade is pretty much dead youmuus is now back in action riot just swaps these 2 around all the time no clue why they cant balance both
 runes a few untouched or slightly touched runes like fleet or phase rush are very strong right now electrocute is likely niche comapred to first strike and dark harvest comet loses power vs aery and aery becomes very strong

buffs

 jinx is back in action and super popular again the r buff was likely not needed the p and hp buffs on top of the longer games already help her a lot
 milio goes back to the strong side similar to jinx he was buffed a bit more than needed
 with ziggs bot is awesome he is also good mid now
 i love how riot buffed morgana e nerf and r buff to make her ult actually matter
 galio is still the same galio

nerfs

 belveth got a hefty nerf and even the crit buff cant make up for it triple nerf in one patch
 kaisa is down you definitely feel the armor nerf
 akshan and quinn are still playable and fine

"okay trust me the title doesnt say the full picture of my thoughts im a lpl fan and i do think lpl should be the slight favorites for this worlds because of this insane jdg team and great lpl summer split but i think im unlike other lpl fans that im not confident about the overall lpl showing at all and this is because of the swiss stage a lpl team implodes in worlds every single goddamn year and im honestly getting a bit traumatized by it feels like ever since 2020 every lpl team gets rated highly coming into worlds but 1 or 2 teams shit the bed in group stage while lck gets every team in quarters im tired of this expectation just to feel depressed in group this year swiss stage so im fully expecting wbg and one of blglng to not make it at this point if they all do ill be very pleasantly surprised and happy but im not expecting it 

but once lpl reaches the knockout stage im very confident in them i thought that edg could genuinely win vs dk when they were huge underdogs i thought rng were as good as t1 when the 180 t1 roster was considered by fans to be the greatest roster ever

the crazy thing is that i think lpl has a much higher chance of winning worlds than actually getting all 4 teams into knockout stage the scrims rumor so far support this happening again as well im not one of those ppl who think scrims dont matter well its fair if you do but the current scrim rumor is that the best scrim teams are all lck teams and jdgg2 all lck teams and the chinese 1st seed in semis has happened for the last 2 years albeit due to different reasons such as cn vs cn in quarters and fpx drama but it doesnt inspire confidence

so lpl fans how do you stay so confident i need some of that copium i think western fans were the ones that needed copium but i need some rn ill not be happy if its the jdg and lck show and jdg wins worlds",Bad Teammates

"i havent watched a lot of pro games this year so im totally lost i have correctly predicted gam and bds win in the playins but who do i pick for swiss stage please

i currently have 

all lck teams minus t1  heard there were some faker shenanigans 

lpl teams minus weibo  no idea why theres always that one team from the lpl that underperforms i dont watch lpl its just blind roll

lec  g2 only id love to click fnc or bds but i dont feel like lec is as strong as it was in 2017 or so new fnc without rekkles feel reckless

lcs  historically all lcs teams suck beside c9 which field emenes so its kind of a case of itself nrg look very favored to me but i have no hope for lcs due to their international performance and golden guardians fiasco i saw before playins

as a result of necrits recent video regarding changes to the league of legends website i was thinking about the history of the website  i used to visit the website daily because of the boards but once those were removed i dont think i ever used the website again for anything  i think riot really made a mistake and reduced their traffic by a massive amount  sadly this also means that their lore and map almost never gets used  just wanted to share and see what people have to say about this more or less i was communicating that riot needs to bring back some form of interaction on their website where they can bring in people regularly,Bad Teammates

"okay let me start by giving an example of the opposite of a win more champion lets talk about thresh i think hes a great example because hes generally pretty liked and considered to be good design 

ampx200b

in a situation where you are in a winning situation as thresh you have tools that allow you to win more good hooks aggressive abilities etc in situations where you are losing you have tools that allow you to lose less defensive cc and utility escape tools etc

ampx200b

compare this to the most recent addition to the game briar does briar have tools that let her win more absolutely briar is amazing when ahead even only a few hundred gold her kit is excellent for snowballing and gaining traction now the important part does briar have tools that let her lose less no 

ampx200b

i think this tends to be overwhelmingly true for champions released in the past 5 years who are disliked they have tools that allow them to snowball hard and carry a lead but they have basically zero tools that are useful when behind the characters feel oppressive when ahead and so forgettable when behind that you dont think about the times youve played against them and won 

ampx200b

even comparing a lot of the less hated new additions to the game seraphine vex lillia theres a clear trend of all of these champions having atleast a few defensive tools these champions are absolutley powerful when ahead but not in the same way as yone or samira 

ampx200b

a lot of the champions that people hate tend to be the ones who are oppressive when ahead and useless when behind ",Bad Teammates
" hextech gunblade was in the game for 10 years i honestly never heard the community complain about it occasionally some would say it made katakali oppressive but those champs were top tier for years after the item was removed anyway compare it to complaints from stopwatch banner of command hullbreaker stridbreakerdash active etc it was never an item anyone truly had an issue with it was actually a lot of fun people loved it everyone did

arguments against

1 but it acutally will make katakali oppressive  shut up who cares figure out how to deal with it
2 but it gives champs without cc cc and wiping away drool from chin champs with ccextra cc  so what shut up
3 sustain is not stammering s s supposed to be in thbe game anymore  so what shut up
4 it will loudly breathing and swallows saliva throw off the meta  the meta is boring and sucks anyway so what shut up
5 blah blah blah insert any argument against bringing gunblade back next patch  shut up

having an extra way to interact and make plays in the game via an item is 100x more fun than solely relying on your champs kit it allowed for more brainmode plays and it has plenty of counterplay still its not an auto win item think of all the screaming the lcs casters can do when somebody zap kills someone think of the pogchamps in lcs twitch chat

much of the sustain the game used to have has been removed or mitigated but i dont see how anyone can possibly find lack of sustainhealing fun it just means that you have to go back and forth from fountain far more often and are less able to make plays after a fight or duel zzzzzzzz the heal on the item wasnt overly op anyway it allowed you to gradually heal back to full health after 2 to 4 full minion waves depending on the point in the game and sustain a bit in lane example if kayle is vs malphite it allows kayle to somewhat persist in lane rather than permanently losing 13hp from one mindless malphite q and having to back or getting 1 shot ulted scoffs loudly ah ha hes a kayle player that explains why he wants it back1  shhhh be quiet

theres apparently a trend to pull away a bit from item actives wow thats so fun only playing in my little niche while another lane loses and having no agency or carry potential is not fun gunblade allows for more playmaking and opportunities to the champions that build it its a 3600 gold item so its something you have to work for as well

just bring it back if it truly messes stuff up then you can get rid of it again the game is the most straight up dead and boring grindfest its ever been the worst player in the game has too much agency and matchups have too little counterplay giving players an item that give people more opportunities and possibilities to carry is better for everyone better for me better for you yes you because everyone can build it me you your top your mid anyone that wants it im going to build one right now in my garage",Champion Design
"disclaimer my goal is not to generate dramahate but rather to start a discussion im not the ultimate authority and i might not be the best player but im here to share my perspective

good evening gentlemen after playing this game since 2013 id like to share my opinion on why im not enjoying the current state of the game ive been playing inmaster as a support for quite some time now and ive noticed several things that bother me i wanted to get this off my chest and see if im the only one who thinks this way

1 jungle gt literally every game from d1 and above is solely dependent on the jungle its like a best jungle wins scenario in several games ive started an experiment of looking at the kda of both junglers at the end of the game and the winning team always has the jungler with better performance and its always a significant difference practically 90 of the games are like this basically the feeling you get is that when you queue up no matter what you do its best jung wins its like gambling hoping for a good jungle to be on your team as a support i try to secure objectives and make invades but if my jungler is not paying attention and doesnt read the game correctly whats the point of me playing well in the end league of legends has become a game where one person can carry the match and theres almost nothing i can do
2 adc gt currently its the most frustrating lane to play ive seen numerous games where a 143 adc loses the game and becomes irrelevant if you dont play perfectly you cant achieve much while a malphite who throws a tire and jumps into your face wins the game this used to be my main lane but as time went on playing adc became the worst possible experience not even when im winning i have fun most of your game is spent farming and praying to get three items to start making an impact while a oneitem aatrox is already a god moreover every month more champions with five dashes appear making your feeble flash and nothing essentially the same

tldr in high elo 90 of the games are decided by the best jungler and playing adc is currently the worst experience

what would i do i dont know im not a game designer riot is paid to solve this but they seem busy making skins for lux personally i wouldnt mind if they removed the jungle from the game",Bad Teammates
i can excuse bad macro ect but what is up with not using control words in low elo its only 75 and give perma vision as long as it lives u can cover the whole river or jungle with it but i notice barely anyojne uses it ,Ranked Pressure
"the whole point of splits was because people reached their desired ranks in the start of the year and then camped them for the rest of the season so why not add ranked decay  the current diamond decay system would work perfectly in the ranks below higher elo is more strict basically you can have up to 28 banked days so 28 days that you can not play and perserve your rank every single game you play adds 7 days to that counter so you have to basically play 1 game per week or 4 games per month the decay would be 50lp per day if your banked days are over and you drop a maximum of 400lp numbers could vary and change obviously

that is pretty easy on the player even if they have a busy life morever in the end of each month reward players with something for being x rank so that there is motive to play throughout the whole year

3 ranked splits feels more like a chore to regain your old rank every time instead of a fun experience you are not going to be playing to climb higher or maintain your rank you will be playing to just get back to it not very exciting if you ask me

"im currently floating around emerald 2 to emerald 3 this season as its wrapping up  


as one of the few people who used pinging death timers ultimates and players after a good play or to create synergy the new ping system creates an environment that is so unfriendly and devoid of interaction with the team and the game no all chat less pings on the wheel no pinging ally ults or characters with teammates that probably have team chat completely off or pings off   


dont get me started with the rank experience this season the amount of smurfalt accounts this season is atrocious why are we not tieing accounts with a phone number instead of having these accounts plague normal and aram after inting or being toxic was this really the best approach to this problem that existed for so long on top of this it seemed like many games in emerald have a mix of a variety of ranks that play together including silver gold platinum and emerald im not sure if this is occurring at other ranks within the game but this has occurred often this season with the additional tier of emerald being added this has led to many games being ruined from someone being simply outclassed when they go 110 for the entirety of the game it feels out of my control to persuade the match into the teams favor when this is occurring 310 games  


skins this year have been a rollercoaster starting with the ultimate samira skin riot let down and mislead the community on funds in relation to the skin and the overall price of things later on the 200 jhin chroma incident came up as a jhin main the outcry was well deserved and the jhin mains on the subreddit were just outright furious at the decision made to lock the skin behind such an egregious paywall legendary skins are very inconsistent in terms of quality from skin line to skin line coven nami is absolutely stunning and probably the best skin in recent memory the amount of detail that went into it deserves praise but as a skin line is introduced every 2 weeks its hard to be excited or thrilled with the product when they seemed rush more times than not  


im glad the mythic system is leaving in my opinion it led to a balancing nightmare for riot and champion item spikes that had made the experience so frustrating to play the last few seasons the design philosophy around champions having multiple build paths is almost impossible to maintain properly as this was the original design concept in season 11 preseason we will see if the game can return to a healthier state season 10 but many of my friends have already left the game given the number of changes per patch notes needed to fix the item system and the champions in relation to that when it was converted

shadow assasin ult dealing damage based on enemy missing hp and rhaast ult healing based on your own missing hp it kinda just makes sense to me as in his game play pattern his ult is either supposed to be a finisher or for rhaast a form of avoiding damage and getting back cooldowns it would also fix him running through a wall missing every spell and still dealing 50 of ur hp bar with smite ult without removing his only reliable source of getting ult off into very long range comps this is more of an issue for rhaast though,Bad Teammates

i thought that ahri in the midlane is and has been for quite some time the ultimate blind pick i know she has counters but you know what i mean and she is easy to pick new players love her but she is still often play in high elo and even proplay and can do a lot of nice plays if you master her

"the first paragraph is for the context of why i am posting this idea if you want to skip and go straight to the idea it will be the next paragraph

i was watching some old videos from what i consider the glory era of league of legends i see old urgot old mordekaiser old aatrox old quinn old graves old galio old yorick old poppy old pantheon etc etc it made me wish in a way that the current players that werent around for most of these if not all of these were able to experience playing all of the old iterations of these champions i started in season 3 with lissandras release ive experienced most of the ones ive listed but there were even some versions of champions that i wasnt around for ive seen videos of ap master yi beta twisted fate and stuff like that it makes me wish there was a way to experience them again or experience something of the past for the first time which is where the following paragraph comes into play

i have a game mode idea most likely would be for an anniversary event in the future maybe the 20th anniversary just throwing that out there a game mode where not only you could select all the current champions in league of legends but all of the old versions of the champions as well i know some  have been minireworked 3000 times zeri im looking at you but maybe to keep it simple the on release versions of any champion that was considered a full rework i wont count beta for this since that is considered a testing stage so season 1 and onward any champion that had a previous version  imagine going top lane its urgot of today versus the urgot of the past even if the event only lasted a month i think it would be cool to let players experience these old versions of champions to make the game mode even crazier they bring back all the old rifttwisted treelinecrystal scar items that were removed maybe thats too far but this idea is already too far in my own eyes but i wanted to share it anyways

let me start with im part of the sad regions that do not have normal draft so if quick play straight up removes blind pick i will not have a ranked option on summoners rift apart from quick play 

im one of those players who plays fill in normals and likes to match my champ to my team comp i play most roles equally as badly so it doesnt really matter  however quick play taking over blind pick seems quite worrying for me the whole shtick of my friend group is we are all fill players and depending on the mood we all swap out our roles and champs or play with knowledge of what our new guest friend is picking 

 quick play may remove this from my friend group and we usually play as a group of 3 and 4 so playing ranked flex isnt a consistent thing to do i can play soloq when playing alone  

this wouldnt be an issue if there was any other normal play mode but saying it will completely replace blind pick is quite worrying for me will smaller regions only have quick play  or will smaller regions finally have two normal modes",Bad Teammates

hello 

sorry for not being able to post here yesterday 

here are the most notable changes for today

 bds reverse swept psg sorry for those of you who predicted 0 reverse sweeps
 kaisa is now the most picked champion while xayah dropped to 2nd place
 orianna joins maokai as the most banned champion and both neeko and rumble get on the board
 viego makes an appearance as the champion with the 2nd highest wr with 71
 three more champions join rell and maokai as the champions that have been played in more than one role poppy taliyah and sett
 the player with the highest kda category changed completely with all the previous headliners being eliminated from the tournament
 bds crownie is now the player with most kills in a single game with 13 kills
 tw beanj now leads for most first blood kills however as he has been eliminated the most likely leaders are now bds crownie and gam palette
 bds adam and gam levi join bds sheo as the players with more different champions played 7
 bds and gam are now the teams with most different champions played if they manage to stay in the tournament for a while its likely that they wont be overthrown
 we now know that gam is the team from a minor region that made it further into the tournament so if you picked gam congratulations
 we have a new longest game psg vs bds which lasted 4355 just 1 minute and 5 seconds shy from the 45 min necessary for some people to win those sweet pickem points one interesting fact ever since the beginning of the tournament the longest game has been between bds and another team

why do some categories have only 1 or 2 results

i only show ranks that 3 or less playerschampionsteams dispute to keep it simple

why doesnt the image show maokai as been played in 3 different roles

since last year riot counted seraphine who didnt buy a support item but was played by a support player as support im using that precedence as a rule so basically if maokai was played by a support player regardless of having bought a support item or not im going to count him towards being played as a support

see you tomorrow",Bad Teammates
okay so im playing league for around half a year maybe now i am in gold 3 and playing with emeraldplat players and i get the feeling that im getting carried and not doing enough for my team im really trying my best but i keep getting matched with really high ranked players i want to main riven but my match ups are pretty hard cause they are definitely above my skill level i think so what are the best ways to make myself useful as a riven main any players out there some tips check my account 18196 my k participation and damage are really low cause i just try to survive in the lane phase and not die,Bad Teammates
"kameto ceo of kc tweeted this  httpstwittercomkammetostatus1714315510853116234t85u3uvty9antnm8sequibwamps19

a lot of kc official fan accounts as well as team members or any kcaffiliated media like yamatocannon have been tweeting cryptic yet hyped and positive kcrelated content for almost an hour this includes lec wooloo big teaser and esport insider

picture itself tweeted by kameto is explicit enough to show something very big happened he also said during kcx3 that the 14th october would bring him and the team the answers regarding their admissions within the lec

of course we are waiting for a bilateral announcement by both the official lec team and lol esport officials

"this is a character concept i came up with a while ago and i was wondering how it would hold up in modern league its kind of inspired by the magic archer in clash royale obviously all numbers would be subject to balance so dont go too hard on those elements 

ampx200b

passive  mark of illumination 

damaging an enemy champion with a light arrow marks them for 4 seconds attacking marked enemies detonate the mark exploding and dealing 50 bad and granting 2575 with level move speed for 15 seconds  

q  arrow of light 

fire an arrow of light passes through enemies dealing 80 ad  10 per 20 critical strike chance damage and extending when damaging enemy champions 

applies onhit effects

 attack speed reduces the cast time and cooldown of this ability

 deals 60100 based on level of its normal damage to minions

w  shining altar 

place a destructible altar that mimics your use of light arrows towards your cursor dealing 60 of its normal damage

e  grace in brilliance 

leap towards your altar if you are already near it you jump in a target direction after leaping gain 40 attack speed for 4 seconds

if there is no altar this ability resets the cooldown of shining altar and you gain 40 attacks speed for 4 seconds 

r  sunburst 

launch a concentrated orb of light that explodes after traveling a certain distance or comes into contact with a champion dealing 150 ad damage and marking enemies hit with a mark of light

for the next 10 seconds the explosion from mark of illumination will detonate other marks and detonating marks heals for 30160 with level 

detonating marks on nonchampions deals 20 and heals for 20 of its normal value but still detonates other marks

"dont get me wrong im not an expert on the subject so my opinion probably means squat but ive been playing league for about 8 years so i at least know what some things are or were like the obvious ones are

 meta gotta change things to keep em fresh
 new championsthe sheer number of champions

but after 13 years and what millions upon millions of dollars and you cant even come close to not having both absurdly strong and absurdly weak champions i get it testing the waters is a part of balance but thats what the entire pbe is for and for bugs of course look at duskblade for crying out loud am i expecting perfection  no not in the slightest i just want a decent game where i can actually play and fight the other opponent instead of it being a oneway stomp fest

on a side note do you think infinitely stacking champions pose a threat to balance id love to hear peoples thoughts on that too

"jdg coming to worlds seems unbeatable 

top 369 might as well call him 789 now with his performance this season he can play carry top he can play a tank for his team he can do anything he plays with kanavi extremely well to do exactly what the team needs from him

jg kanavi  imo the best player in the worldmost impactful right now even more dangerous that hes paired with lpls best middebatable and top if kanavi gets a good start gg

mid knight  probably the weak point of this team not to say he is a bad player in any way he has just shown some inconsistencies especially in global stages still not a player to count out though and is only a weak point due to his exceptional teammates

adc  sup ruler is so fucking good at adc he gives jdg the confidence that allows the team to play at their own pace ahead in the game kanavi 369 will win you the game early game didnt go as planned just wait for ruler to scale theres nobody that can put team fight him 
ruler  missing is also very formidable in lane this season honestly 0 downsides for these two

"okay let me start by giving an example of the opposite of a win more champion lets talk about thresh i think hes a great example because hes generally pretty liked and considered to be good design 

ampx200b

in a situation where you are in a winning situation as thresh you have tools that allow you to win more good hooks aggressive abilities etc in situations where you are losing you have tools that allow you to lose less defensive cc and utility escape tools etc

ampx200b

compare this to the most recent addition to the game briar does briar have tools that let her win more absolutely briar is amazing when ahead even only a few hundred gold her kit is excellent for snowballing and gaining traction now the important part does briar have tools that let her lose less no 

ampx200b

i think this tends to be overwhelmingly true for champions released in the past 5 years who are disliked they have tools that allow them to snowball hard and carry a lead but they have basically zero tools that are useful when behind the characters feel oppressive when ahead and so forgettable when behind that you dont think about the times youve played against them and won 

ampx200b

even comparing a lot of the less hated new additions to the game seraphine vex lillia theres a clear trend of all of these champions having atleast a few defensive tools these champions are absolutley powerful when ahead but not in the same way as yone or samira 

ampx200b

a lot of the champions that people hate tend to be the ones who are oppressive when ahead and useless when behind ",Bad Teammates

"ive never seen the swiss format before so i decided to create a python script to simulate it i ran this simulation millions of times collecting data for analysis what ive found is quite interesting

a common narrative im hearing about swiss from people whove seen it in other esports is that if theres an upset things will get weird  

while its true its also missing something big the swiss stage does not need upsets to get weird

to prove this point i want to rank the teams and to remove my own bias we can use the outright betting odds from multiple sites and take the averages this is what it looks like



 rank  region  team  outright win odds 

 1     lpl     jdg   1445        
 2     lck     geng  4389        
 3     lpl     lng   5515        
 4     lck     t1    753         
 5     lpl     wbg   9083        
 6     lpl     blg   9333        
 7     lck     kt    1241        
 8     lck     dk    145         
 9     lec     g2    40553       
 10    lec     fnc   78333       
 11    lec     mad   88667       
 12    lcs     c9    98333       
 13    lcs     nrg   177777      
 14    lcs     tl    252777      
 15    lec     bds   275          
 16    vcs     gam   444444      

thankfully region distribution works out neatly the top 8 teams are from the lck and lpl and theres a bit of a gulf between dk rank 8 and g2 rank 9

lets define an upset as any rank 916 team beating a rank 1 to 8 team which is the same as saying an upset is an leclcsvcs team beating a lcklpl team

i ran the simulation while setting the chance of upsets to 0 and gave regions win rates heres a chart of it

 region 1  region 2  region 1 wr 

 lck       lck       50             
 lck       lpl       50             
 lck       lcs       100            
 lck       lec       100            
 lck       vcs       100            
 lpl       lpl       50             
 lpl       lcs       100            
 lpl       lec       100            
 lpl       vcs       100            
 lcs       lcs       50             
 lcs       lec       50             
 lcs       vcs       50             
 lec       lec       50             
 lec       vcs       50             
 vcs       vcs       50             
 vcs       pi        50             


to summarise the chart if a 1 to 8th ranked team is playing a 9 to 16th ranked team they have a 100 win rate every other matchup is a 50 win rate 

now this is where things get juicy

i ran the simulation 100k times and these are the results

 teams advancing  nonlcklpl 

 0                37814       
 1                60756       
 2                1429        
 3                1           
 4                0           


without ever beating an lck or lpl team 1 or more leclcsvcs teams advance in 62 of simulations

the real clever ones reading this probably have also realised that for this to be true lpllck teams will be going home without ever losing to anyone but lpllck teams

pretty cool for the west right bare in mind these stats above are an absolute minimum as clearly the western teams will have a better win rate against lpllck teams than 0 surely

if we compare swiss with the old groups format using the same seeding pools youll see how much better this format is for us 

with the old format using the same winrate method as above not a single leclcsvcs team will ever advance to quarters this is because each group will have an lck team and an lpl team and they will get 4 wins plus meanwhile this means the other 2 teams lose 4 each at a minimum

due to the increased randomness of swiss over the old groups stage and to the detriment of getting the true best 8 teams into the finals the west is definitely happy here should we feel bad that its very likely an lck  lpl team will drop out of the tournament by losing only to lck  lpl teams probably but hey it will be nice to win for once

i have more data using dummy team by team win rates trying to simulate closer to what will happen i got to these win rates by working backwards from the outright winning odds and trial and error with win rates until the output matched the outright perhaps ill go in depth of it thats for another post though here are some interesting things i learned bare in mind the accuracy relies on the quality of the input and its impossible to know the true odds before teams play

1 in swiss the average rank difference between teams in games is smaller than groups by approximately 11 meaning we get more competitive matches groups has far more completely one sided matchups

2 over 72 of scenarios had 2 or more leclcsvcs teams advancing

3  only 13 of scenarios had 0 leclcsvcs teams advancing so 987 had at least 1",Champion Design

"i know that this champion is getting his fair share of hate deserved too but i dont think this change was in the right direction 

i am by no means a ksante onetrick or anything like that but he was in my champion pool before the changes now i dont even wantto play him anymore because it is just not fun almost all the combos were removed you can not q3  flash anymore you cant e  tapw you cant flash  tapw and your q3 expires when you ult the only combo you have now is e  q3  w  r where is the skill expression in that why is riot just killing his entire identity on top of these removes your passive damage in all out is reduced to a flat 35 percent increase which removes a significant amount of damage from his kit understandable so his passive dealt too much true damage in the late game but why are they also removing the damage increase of his w his w is now at a set damage only increased by the bonus ad from all out this w change in particular is resposible for extremely many solo kills not happening because youre not properly able to finish the enemy off i do believe riot needs to revert the w changes cause  if you hit a perfect combo on a 75 health target at level 6 and it does not die it just feels extremely unrewarding all this is not even considering the fact that you have to channel your w for at least 065 seconds which often leads to people flashing away of course the tap w was probably too fast but to wait 065 seconds 05 seconds in all out on a mediocre damage spell which doesnt even have execute damage anymore feels wrong

you also can not heal on anything else but champions anymore the overall healing percentage was lowered aswell in exchange we got 10 more health in the all out form this compensation only leads to more frustration when you ult you lose 85 of your bonus resistances which means you get oneshot lowering the healing makes you even more squishy 10 more health will not help much coupled with his w and passivenerfs you basically dont heal

the atkspeed you get when in allout does not even make any sense because you have 2 aaresets in your kit rendering any excess atkspeed useless lowering the damage when ulting someone through a wall was also reduced should you not be rewarded for ulting someone through a wall yet another skill expression being removed apscaling also doesnt make any sense lol

so what did riotgames achieve with these changes

1 every ksante player hates these changes it removes many skill expressions and very much of the fun factor of ksante
2 ksante is still dashing in 1v5 tanking for an eternity meaning the most toxic part of his kit was not adressed he is still an absolute maniac full tank which dashes into 3 people and knocks them into his team barely losing any hp 
3 kill threat is very low as ksantes damage output was significantly lowered while also reducing his defensive measures omnivamp tapw

ampx200b

how could riot have made better changes

1 nerf passive all out damage maybe let it scale with lvl or just lower the damage increase from 20 per 100 ad amp mr to 15 or 10 per 100 ad amp mr
2 leave core mechanics like q3  flash e  w and the q3 after entering all out in his kit
3 lower overall damage of w maybe take off some percentages while still keeping some sort of damage increase during all out
4 leave his hp during all out at 55 while lowering his omnivamp a little keep in mind he can only heal himself up to 55 that way
5 the lower base health and higher health growth changes were ok aswell as nerfing q in the early levels

what is wrong with letting ksante keep his identity and just lowering his numbers to make him more balanced

anyways i know opinions vary but im still very interested in what other people think

when i make this comparison i understand that it isnt exactly the same because you dont lose the currency after the it ends but imagine if you had an event pass and they didnt tell you there are more prestige skins and chromas coming  some people might just buy as soon as they get the funds only to be upset when they realise the next prestige skin in the event pass was better

"is there any champ who builds this item consistenly

compared to rav hydra is worse on any champ who needs extra wave clear camille fiora etc

not even the weird onhit adcs build that item anymore vayne varus 98tek twitch 

i think this is mainly because steraks is not shit anymore so a lot of people replaced hydra with sterak and hullbreaker exists so you already have way too much hp on your build champions that abused the hpgtad conversion are building sunfire and dealing damage by standing still  it doesnt have the autoattack reset that used to and shen got nerfed to the ground so you just dont build this anymore unless you are doing some weird hearsteel stacking tech",Champion Design

"skinspotlights has noticed that an artist for the coven ward kudos productions responsible for a good amount of riots art production put up a video on the sfx however it is noted in that video that both mid top and baron have significant changes to the map structure potentially coming from preseason changes worth noting if these are from an early test they could have been scrapped or changed since then but interesting nevertheless 

specific changes appear to be that the opening to mid from each blue has been pushed back to around the t1 turret tribrush in top is missing entirely and is blocked off and baron pit appears to be far more open having no terrain around it at all on the minimap

ive been getting back into ranked after not playing in multiple seasons i managed to get from bronze 3 to silver 3 but im running into the issue of im now vsing people who r proficient at 1 character ive never really had a main i get really bored of using the same character every game i try to play characters that can solo carry or make a big difference in the game but it still isnt enough i think focusing one legend would really help me but i just cant find any that i can play game after game for roles i basically can play every role well i have thousands of hours in draft just not much in ranked so ive tried every legend for 50 or more games i just dont know what to do ,Bad Teammates

when all through the korea  
not a player was scrimming  
not even a nilah  

the stage was set up in seoul with care  
in hopes that saint mata would soon be there

with visions of gods winning by any means  

when out on the stage arose such a chatter  
i sprang from my chair to see what was the matter    
away to the window i flew like a braum    
to close down the shutters and turn up my sound

de  wieviele partien wird es geben in welchem das team gewinnt das beim erreichen des matchpunkts benachteiligt ist aus insgesamt 9partien   means that the team that is behind when one of the team reaches 2 wins proceeds to win the series so 12 into 32 is possible

esp  cuántas remontadas veremos en el mundial de un total de 9 series al mejor de cinco   remontada technically only is a comeback so it could also once again mean go to 12 to a 32 win

"for those who dont know alois is a challenger top lane player he peaked rank 8 in euw split 1

ampx200b

this is one of the best top laners in the world losing in emerald elo not once but 23 games he played does this mean alois is a garbage player of course not alois is one of the best top lane players in euw so what does it mean then

ampx200b

it means emerald is extremely unbalanced imagine you are a diamond 4 player in terms of skill and youre placed into these games a challenger no the rank 8 player is still losing in these games so how exactly is a low diamond player supposed to climb well looking at this theres a very easy answer he isnt he cant 

ampx200b

now dont get me wrong here alois is one of the best top laners in euw he will climb out of emerald and with ease it is possible if you are 1k lp above emerald sure but for low diamond players just wanting to reach the rank they belong in no chance none if the best top lane players in the world are losing in this elo there is no chance a diamond player will be able to consistently carry the games necessary to be able to climb out

"this is a character concept i came up with a while ago and i was wondering how it would hold up in modern league its kind of inspired by the magic archer in clash royale obviously all numbers would be subject to balance so dont go too hard on those elements 

ampx200b

passive  mark of illumination 

damaging an enemy champion with a light arrow marks them for 4 seconds attacking marked enemies detonate the mark exploding and dealing 50 bad and granting 2575 with level move speed for 15 seconds  

q  arrow of light 

fire an arrow of light passes through enemies dealing 80 ad  10 per 20 critical strike chance damage and extending when damaging enemy champions 

applies onhit effects

 attack speed reduces the cast time and cooldown of this ability

 deals 60100 based on level of its normal damage to minions

w  shining altar 

place a destructible altar that mimics your use of light arrows towards your cursor dealing 60 of its normal damage

e  grace in brilliance 

leap towards your altar if you are already near it you jump in a target direction after leaping gain 40 attack speed for 4 seconds

if there is no altar this ability resets the cooldown of shining altar and you gain 40 attacks speed for 4 seconds 

r  sunburst 

launch a concentrated orb of light that explodes after traveling a certain distance or comes into contact with a champion dealing 150 ad damage and marking enemies hit with a mark of light

for the next 10 seconds the explosion from mark of illumination will detonate other marks and detonating marks heals for 30160 with level 

detonating marks on nonchampions deals 20 and heals for 20 of its normal value but still detonates other marks

"think about it old league rewarded farming much more than new league did for example if you splitpushed at 1516 minutes in the game while everybody else was fighting for no objective aram midlane you pushed a wave into a camp that was killed in 3seconds doing no dmg to you into the next sidelane wave into a enemy camp into a recall   
and today the camp will kill you at 15minutes or half hp you down while forcing you to waste 15seconds on it or ur entire mana just before you can push out the next wave and if a fight happened  near by well now you feel bad because you lost all ur hp to fight   


so now ur telling urself skip the camp just push the wave well now you only got 2 waves worth of value and have to wait another 30seconds for the next minion wave while ur entire team probably got aced 5v4 meanwhile great good payoff   
honestly this might be just the biggest reason why splitpushing is so much worse nowadays compared to the past and feels so unrewarding today  


in the past players got punished who burgerflipped midlane aramfights over and over with no clear outcome between the two teams because you did this splitpush strat 3 times in a row and now all of a sudden you had massive expgold lead vs everybody else

"basically riot is swapping from unique summoner names specific to league of legends to usernames with a tag across all of their games meaning that while in league of legends you used to have a username different from valorant a unique one too lets say mafiaqiqi now your username will look like mafiaqiqieuw1 across every riot games title

following this main change riot has announced the following adjustments

 name changes cannot be purchased with blue essence anymore they will be purchased using the relevant of 10 ingame currency with a free name change every year
 names will be global across all riot games

i personally believe this change is actually terrible and shouldnt happen due to the following reasons

 you no longer have the feeling of unique identity belonging to you if you thought of a unique funny username that you feel proud of everyone else may use it even in the same server
 your gaming identity is supposed to be a picture of how you would describe yourself in a fiction world by forcing users to select a tag you are limiting the way they can express themselves
 the fact that changing it in less than a year costs 10 following the samira overpriced skin the dark cosmic erasure jhin skin and some may say the redeemed star guardian xayah amp rakan shows that riot has been getting greedy minimal work for tons of profit and while yes this is how companies are supposed to work riot for as long as i remember hasnt been this way i felt like they showed a feeling of caring about players making affordable skins for as low as 400rp now while we still have access to epic skins it is shown that the newest of their choices specifically those that i said above show a feeling of greedyness at least the way i see it
 adding to the above i feel like it should be mentioned that this year riot invested the biggest budget compared to other years on league of legends
 blue essence will be completely useless for people that have unlocked every champion except for essence emporiumsby the time a new champion comes out those players would have plenty of be to buy the champion like 9 times

some argue that this is indeed a good change because

 2 or more people would be able to use the same username

this is true but this doesnt promote unique identities in the game world instead you are gonna see the same usernames on 30 of the games furthermore if someone mains zeri in league and puts a username like iamlightning or he just puts a funny username like alwaysdyingcarry he is gonna be forced to have the same username on valorant and other riot titles where the community there is likely to not get the joke furthermore seeing funny unique usernames gives me a smile most of the time however seeing alwaysdyingcarry username every 9 games makes the joke no longer funny

judging by the comments on their twitter post the majority of the community by far hates this change and i can see myself why however i wondered what reddit would think of this id appreciate if you could all state your opinion and reasoning below and i would be happy to read through most of the comments thank you if you decide to engage in the discussion

ampx200b

edit thank you all for your comments i have read most of them i was originally planning to respond to every single one however i really cant do so there are over 900 comments soon to be 1k i never expected it to be this much your views have given me insights both on how yall see your own username and on how yall perceive the games direction in the future

some points id like to address include the following i will probably keep editing the post with more updates based on what i read

many people are saying that this is not a serious change and the game is free2play etc yep i agree with that i will still keep playing the game after these name changes this post isnt a rant of some sort i simply felt like sharing my opinion and asking on how others perceive this change

if you care about your identity in a game you would not be changing it every x months  while this may be true there are still people who just like changing their ign including me i have used many joke usernames including alwaysdyingcarry hntaisenpai mafiaqiqi parentslost5050 ceo of racism ceo of oxygen and many others that i feel like will at least make a few  of players laugh changing it gives me that feeling of being different and also i make my friends laugh with them when we queue up it also gives me a reason to grind for blue essence while also giving a chance to another player to use them too

uniqueness doesnt matter its just a game lul games and identity no lul   according to some researchhttpswwwpsychologytodaycomintlblogbraintrust201512onlinegamesshowplayerpersonalityandhowchangeit your username and how you choose to play in an online world can hint at your personality and by compiling millions and millions of these data points the researchers point out that they can guess at psychological traits across global populations this is just the first result that came up from a google search if someone dedicades more time i am pretty sure he can find up more about this there are of course other factors in someone choosing a username however it is still your identity it is how you see yourself and want to be seen by fellow players it is something you chose other people to see you for

i dont care lol imagine caring about usernames  this is a post made so that i the op can get a better understanding of what the community thinks about this change if you have nothing to contribute to the discussion then simply stay quiet lol sometimes silence is just the better option i never once mentioned that this is a game changing change or that this will destroy league or anything along those lines i as mentioned above will still keep playing the game even if this change goes through",Bad Teammates
"im gold 1 atm and whenever i get jayce on my team it just feels like an automatic loss hes supposed to be a lane bully if youre skilled enough but every time i see it they just go even or lose lane by the time 20 minutes rolls around they basically turn into a caster minion for the rest of the game but almost worse since they almost always miss their one skill shot either that or they jump on like a melee minion and die within 2 seconds

the champ has one of the worst win rates in the game right now  jayce build with highest winrate  lol runes items and skill orderhttpsugglolchampionsjaycebuildrankgold   just genuinely curious what compels people to pick him

"hello i am not sure if i am the only one here

i used to play dota 2 from 2010 until 2020 and i ranked in the top 100 in north america from 2017 to 2019 however my motivation dropped and it began to feel like a chore to play i stopped playing and started looking for a new game

i tried playing league of legends around 2021 and i fell in love with the game it was so refreshing for my eyes and offered so much to learn but my interest only lasted for a year now after a long break i downloaded league of legends again two weeks ago and im suddenly feeling a competitive drive to play the game

however for some reason im afraid to play ranked games its as if something is preventing me from queuing for ranked matches and i end up in aram queues instead maybe my drive to play and reach the top is not that strong

"this applies to basically every lane since it feels like you can count the characters without attack speed boosts on one hand these days but toplane in particular suffers it used to be i almost never bothered taking ignite top as i prefer cautious play and working with my team but now leaving lane for any purpose  including actually just getting killed  results in your opponent getting even more of a gold lead and most likely knocking your tower down to near half hp 

its even worse if someone as demolish just defend your tower from someone who just got a huge gold and xp lead on you demolish plus an attack speed boost or something else that can wreck a tower like nasus good luck 

also they make playing shen suffering and im not okay with that",Game Balance

according to golgghttpsgolgg 369 currently has 356 career wins this means that he needs 13 more wins to reach his name 

right now jdg has to go through the swiss stage and the knockout stage to win worlds in order to get through the swiss stage you need 4 wins and for the knockout stage you need 9 totaling to 13 wins the only scenario where it doesnt add up is if jdg gets a 12 score in any of the bo3s in swiss

"in the last post i accidently used the wrong version of the code i really should stop naming these things copium_1_1_1 i was watching the divephoria episode and pretty much had an oh shit moment when i realized i apologize for putting out incorrect information that post has been deleted and i am posting this because i dont like bad information floating around because of me so sorry again for multiple posts 

after the round one bracket draw there is a  636  chance that at least one western team makes it out of the swiss stage without ever beating an eastern team the chance for two teams is 07 the very small hopium chance of three is gone 

after looking more deeply at potential first round draws the bad first round draw ends up not being too bad because after this round were getting a round of east vs east and west vs west matchups round two draws end up not mattering as much for the same reason the biggest swings in probability were in round 3 and onward draws

"new flashy champs have smaller animations than old champs ofc while new champs are overloaded so they do small tick damages but with big effects i feel old champs are so damn nukey these days using skills at me and melting my entire hp in a few hits ads used to be like aps  
i know it seems offtopic but i think they should make hard champions by design and not just add more buttons and call it hard i mean they have already tried to make hard champions but they have failed like aphelios and ksante while challenging the challenge was intended to be the hardest they claimed to be it wasnt something like a final ultimate attack from certainlyt overloaded champions like yasuo who isnt really overloaded now have an insanely unique playstyle that makes them difficult while having a lot of buttons and new ones dont even have that compared to 20132016 i felt that 20132016 designs were best at making things difficult without buttons",Champion Design

i understand how people say it takes time to process a ban and therefore they would have to refund lp after the lobby had closed which is the most common answer i hear as to why logistically we couldnt get refunded for intentional feed however in what world is just saying lmao deal with it better than just changing lp after the match

"is there any champ who builds this item consistenly

compared to rav hydra is worse on any champ who needs extra wave clear camille fiora etc

tanks and heavy bruisers like sion or shen dont build it anymore because aegis already deals enough damage by its own and it is also cheaper and gives armor compared to titanics only usable stat being ad hp is kinda worthless on its own 

not even the weird onhit adcs build that item anymore vayne varus 98tek twitch 

i think this is mainly because steraks is not shit anymore so a lot of people replaced hydra with sterak and hullbreaker exists so you already have way too much hp on your build champions that abused the hpgtad conversion are building sunfire and dealing damage by standing still  it doesnt have the autoattack reset that used to and shen got nerfed to the ground so you just dont build this anymore unless you are doing some weird hearsteel stacking tech",Champion Design

interesting to see ruler isnt no1 for any of them after seeing that 80 of western analysts had ruler as the best player in the world often phrasing as its not close too also good to see knight being 1st twice and 2nd once after seeing many people putting knight as the 3rd best mid or as low as 5th 6th player overall

i like this list cause it seems they are actually kinda actually basing it off performance this year except the obvious doinb crisp bias often when you ask pro players like the 10 best players they either barely watch games from all major regions or they base it off scrims or who they like more im looking at you evi having apamen as a your top 5 top laner at worlds",Game Balance
