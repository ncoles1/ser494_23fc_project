"i loved playing xerath and even carried some games with him but right now when i pick him i exactly know that no matter how much i hit it doesnt help

i think he just got forgotten by rito or sth he doesnt really do dmg anymore and espacially in earlygame i feel like most aa are stronger then his abilities

over all i feel like ap isnt really strong in this meta most op champs are ad and really easy to play with

if you want to play some mages you have to hit your abilities in a movementspeed adicted time

"so is the future of league just one gamechanging patch every january and then an entire year of hey guys this patch were buffing x champs ad scaling from 2 to 3 and y champs e damage from 60 to 65 have fun rinse repeated its announced theyre slowing down on champion production going into next year so were only getting two new champs and skarner vgu no other vgus apparently and even if they announce it they take years to make idk it all just seems underwhelming 

do you guys think that with them mentioning that this year is their biggest budget yet so anything theyre working on with this huge budget wont come out for another year or two minimum that theyre secretly working on some huge update like maybe with multiple vgus a new client etc",Bad Teammates

kinda opens nilah up as an option to counter certain supportstanksbriar that have a ton of healing youd just fight back and it would be a stalemate 1v1 might even open nilah up to being played in other roles since she wont be as reliant on teammates to heal herkeep her alive",Bad Teammates

"skinspotlights has noticed that an artist for the coven ward kudos productions responsible for a good amount of riots art production put up a video on the sfx however it is noted in that video that both mid top and baron have significant changes to the map structure potentially coming from preseason changes worth noting if these are from an early test they could have been scrapped or changed since then but interesting nevertheless 

specific changes appear to be that the opening to mid from each blue has been pushed back to around the t1 turret tribrush in top is missing entirely and is blocked off and baron pit appears to be far more open having no terrain around it at all on the minimap

"imagine you only have enough time to play this game twice every day and you want to play it the way you want to except you are filled twice in a row

playing offrole is like jury duty its forced and no one really likes to do it its just a chore thats mandatory to the community but at least for jury duty no one has to do it two times in a row

imagine coming home from a shift after working for the entire day and you basically have to do a chore for an hour and a half instead being able to relax i think many people would prefer to wait fifteen minutes for a queue than play their off role twice and wait an hour and thirty minutes to play the game basically",Champion Design
"seriously every time i see this thing on my games he completely runs away with the match once he gets rylais and a couple passive stacks rylais being a completely different issue that i feel should be addressed at some point by giving it a cooldown or something

hes at a 5227 winrate on emerald according to ugghttpsugg and has been hovering around that winrate for literal months every time ive checked how is that winrate ok for such a straightforward sit back and farm up champion pick rate isnt anything super low 38 seems pretty standard in such a contested lane full of different picks

like maybe if his god status was delayed a little bit id understand but unless he plays like a total ass and permashoves while being camped by the enemy jungler this dick always seems to hit his supernova by minute 15 of the game at which point good luck winning any teamfight unless your team drafted malph amumu vladimir taric mf or some bronzodia bs like that

yes i am salty and yes i am biased but seriously am i missing anything how is this champion fair or balanced atm what are any actual meaningful weaknesses that can be exploited to set him back severely or anything that isnt lol just cc him or lol just camp him 247

is there any or should i just permaban him every game going forward",Champion Design

ive heard people talk about smurfs being a huge problem in the past but as abusers crack the code it gets worse im not talking about good players playing on accounts that are lower ranked than what they are its two fold in that now ive seen multiple accounts where the player is a fully automated bot doing nothing besides being active within the game to lose until they hit low iron and then get sold to players to ruin even more games so not only do smurfs ruin the game by being unstoppable theyre even more oppressive when theyre not an actual person because they can be fully automated to play games 247 intentionally losing so that they can make even more money how long before every lobby emerald and below has at least one bot,Bad Teammates
"look i wont lie to myself the honor level 5 rewords are hot booty cheeks but all you have to do is play the game and not call people slurs is it really that hard to just competitive bs and say damn youre playing master yi clearly youre ass at the game or something along those nature  


i know league is probably one of the most toxic communities out there but as someone who competitive bss a lot honor level 5 is not that hard to get infact i think its the easiest part about this game   


ive been playing this game for about 3 years now and usually get honor level 5 within a few months of the reset because i dont understand peoples desire to tell everyone to keep themselves safe or call them racial or derogatory slurs its a video game 

what prompted me to ask this is because my friend recently just posted in my discord that he managed to reach honor level 0 and while i would be surprised i know the man and im not surprised but ive seen people here and twitter saying getting honor level 5 is too hard for what its worth i promise you its not unless theres some secret about honor level i dont know about thats holding people back

"full preview 

jungle followup jungle followup isnt listed here but we plan on returning the ad ratio to the pet and adjusting some of the healing values our short term plans are to get the within role balance back so the different classes and the champions within them are each viable again 

belveth were trying to buff e a bit especially now that its worse at early ranks without further encouraging a few points q gt e max 

hecarim hec was disproportionately hit by the blue pet changes were adding some basead back to get him more onto sheen builds rather than lethality

ksante lots of bugfixes for ksante increasing damage in all out form and lowering cast time on q with hp purchases

leblanc buffs to w as her bread and butter spell and e as the spell that has more gameplay

aurelion sol taking some amount of damage out of tap qs and moving more towards the burst qs in addition to moving some damage out of level scaling and into rank scaling

briar were a bit of power out of her statcheck she should still be good at it while retaining lane briar being reasonably powerful

cait discussed cait yesterday but we think lethality cait shouldnt be her most powerful build

jinx this change should allow jinxs passive to still result in those unleashed moments while capping some of the high end cases that seem a bit much

rammus taking his damage down a bunch through both w converting to resists and early q damage with the pet resist synergies this should also reduce clear time by some amount

brandzyra some small adjustments to get a few more mages and aps into the jungle not trying to displace their main roles

seraphine through their pickrate seraphine players have expressed their desire to play her in the support position this doesnt mean that were making midbot seraphine dead but trying to narrow the gap between them 

hullbreaker we opted to pure nerf hullbreaker as it is degrading some side lane patterns a bit much needing to buy hullbreaker to match another hullbreaker is not a particularly desirable pattern  httpstwittercomriotphroxzonstatus1714457786405548502

"recently watched this video of a professional player raging about how yone loses to fiora level 1 and how the game isnt balanced because it wasnt close this line of thinking and blatant whinging really bugs me and i want to explain why video below   
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbygby2diw1wamplcugy6cdbla1_kubf9114aaabag9vqhww97ee79vyslz8gamchttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbygby2diw1wamplcugy6cdbla1_kubf9114aaabag9vqhww97ee79vyslz8gamc  


now im not an esports pro but i play a lot of league i think its rather common knowledge that fiora has one of the strongest level 1s in the game next to tryndamere and darius in this video you will see fiora engage into the yones caster minions to proc a vital the yone immediately responds with his q and follows up with autos to begin stacking lethal tempo they both begin to kite out the fiora kites away from his minions and yone begins to kite into the fioras minions yones lethal tempo gets fully stacked and utilizes auto resets with q to dish out a lot of damage while fiora does the same while also procing vitals the 1v1 ends when fiora predicts the yones flash at the beginning of her auto attack animation securing the vital proc at the end of her auto attack animation   


the argument from the pro is that the 1v1 was not even close and the game is clearly not balanced at all because the fiora was tanking the yones caster minions clearly tanking caster minions in a 1v1 at level 1 means you should auto lose according to his logic while it is true fiora took more aggro than yone here the yone still took plenty of aggro himself and also doesnt have bone plating like fiora does which is has a huge impact early game on all ins   


personally i find it really disingenuous for a few reasons here and ill explain why its rage bait 

1 professional players should know that champions have power spikes at different levels a champion may be weaker earlier than they are mid to late game and vice versa i note this because again fiora has an extremely strong level 1 because of her passive and yone has what lethal tempo and q professionals should not advertise that all champions should be of equal strength at all levels of the game even if that means 1 champion can tank 6 more hits from minions at level 1 
2 no one wants a game where all champions are of equal strength at all stages and period of the game people obviously want to be able to have an advantage over others at certain time to push advantages because of this there will always be a champion that is stronger than another champion at level 1 even if that means tanking 6 more hits from a caster minion 
3 even if the yone did more damage level 1 or fiora has less base health level 1 should the yone be expected to win despite not guarding his vitals the yone decided to all in instead of backing out he did not guard his vitals using terrain nor did he win the flash prediction the fiora played it well enough to proc the vitals why should fiora lose anyway when she executed the function and identity of her champion while yone doesnt even have any crit yet of course later on in the game it might be impossible to use terrain to block vitals which is why later on in the game it is more about the number of vitals procd 

this kind of complaining without acknowledging the differences in champion and game mechanics is completely dishonest and does not help people playing the game actually understand how and why a champions should win fights i would expect high elo players to already know that fiora wins level 1 and instead of kiting into her minions and committing to an all in where you didnt even get the first hit in kiting back to the safety of the tower or at least staying near your minions to keep that advantage it was really only when the yone committed to the fight and started taking minion aggro himself that he lost the fight in this kind of high elo match up yone shook hands with fiora and agreed to the fight ",Champion Design

i graciously rise from my 29arammarathoninduced slumber at the highly productive hour of 2 am with immense enthusiasm i shout to the heavens another day another triumph in the prestigious aram mode of league of legends

as i click the league of legends icon im greeted by an enigmatic app called riot client  it dares to demand my username and password curiosity piqued i decide to create a fresh account of the day behold leesinsblind is born and it tells me ive successfully signed up in oce a realm i have absolutely no clue about riot games the masterminds behind league of legends mustve recognized my true potential and granted me this unheardof rank

i dive into a brisk warmup aram and what do you know lee sin graces me with his presence to clarify for the less enlightened among you lee sin is a jackofalltrades masterofeverything champion his hidden passive rendering me blind as a bat and not due to any moonshine incident mind you

his q ability is an autotargeted missile that homes in on the nearest adc whether in this game or the next revealing their location and providing me with vital information like their credit score and their mothers relationship status if im not satisfied with their financial health a quick qpress sends them packing wiping their league account and transferring their gold to my offshore bank account

my w ability involves dashing to an ally and shielding them but lets be real shields are overrated when youve already started the game with four death dances and can heal from true damage no big deal

my e well it marks the area around lee sin essentially functioning as an aoe nuke unfortunately it only obliterates nearby champions and provides a meager 300 ingame currency such a pittance i know

and now lee sins pi√®ce de r√©sistance his ultimate r trying to explain it to mere mortals is a task reserved for the elite minds of at least bronze 4 ill demonstrate its incredible power in due course

as the game begins the enemy team quakes in terror at the mere sight of me lee sin who shows no mercy i order them to line up in front of their nexus as their towers and inhibitors have wisely sworn allegiance to my cause their feeble cries fall on deaf ears as i meticulously pass judgment with my q one by one

but this becomes tiresome im already drained from the monumental effort of queuing up so i hit that e button instantly obliterating all players and granting me a handsome stack of gold to purchase my one and only necessary item duskblade of draktharr i even venmo some random ornn player to upgrade it to draktharrs shadowcarver because lets face it im too busy being awesome

the enemy team attempts to surrender realizing their futility against my unparalleled might but i the benevolent lee sin reject their pleas as i eagerly await the airdrop of my new item

at last i decide its time to claim my rightful victory i casually stroll up to the enemy rammus whos rocking a cool 971 armor and press my ultimate at him together we watch in awe as he rockets towards his own nexus shattering their base and presumably his monitor along with it

the victory screen warmly welcomes me and with the profound humility only lee sin can muster i queue up for another exhilarating all random all mid because really why waste time on anything else",Bad Teammates

jinx on the other hand did nothing this game for some reason this emerald player did not think that buying infinity edge was a good choice so instead opted for stormrazor   


yes i could have built liandrys to do some max hp dmg but it would then hurt my damage against the carrys how can rammus be able to carry this team just because he is a tank while the xerath with 23 kills cant make a dent in his hp

if its not a rammus that stand 1v5 and wont die its a yone splitpushing with hullbreaker that needs 2 people to stop tanks and bruisers are just too strong to the point other classes dont stand a chance

in this case we lost in draft since we would have been forced to pick an adc like vayne with  hp damage or some other champion who can handle rammus since my spells do minimal damage unless i focus my whole build around him and jinx kills herself if she autos him

"evelynn is currently a s tier jungler according to ugg and is sitting at 53 winrate with a 15 banratehttpsugglolchampionsevelynnbuild at master and challenger her banrate surpasses 18 she also has been an s tier jungler for a ton of patches she is also one of the very few champions which can build mejai and get away with it due to her massive safety allowing her to avoid dying

the issue with evelynn is that traditional form of counterplay against both classes junglers and assassins doesnt work against evelynn

 against most other junglers you can just ward this will make their ganks telegraphed allowing you to react accordingly against junglers that can either become invisible bypass walls or have a long range dash and can gank from different angles such as zac khazix shaco kayn you can ward in other places even though warding becomes more difficult
  this doesnt work against evelynn why because she is perpetually invisible it only works before level 6 after that your only option is to either give up lane dominance or risk being ganked by her because evelynn is perpetually invisible warding doesnt work because you can only use one pink ward and evelynn can just gank from other angles and she will ignore normal wards due to that you can ward evelynns camps to know where she is and guess where she will gank but that isnt feasible because you have too a limited number of wards to use and it is not just you but your allies also need to ward her camps which is a massive level of coordination that you cant find in your average soloq game also unlike rengar evelynn can avoid activating her w which makes her ganks even less telegraphed even if they will be weaker if she doesnt use w

 against most other assassins you can pick tanks or bulky juggernauts they cant be bursted from full health like squishies can for obvious reasons health and resistance stacking prevents that assassins can kill them but only when they have been significantly weakened enough or if they are behind enough
  this doesnt work against evelynn why because her w shreds a percentage of your magic resistance not a flat amount so it works even against magic resistance stacking her e does damage based on your max health and the percentage scales with ap unlike most other percentage health mechanisms in the game and her r does a ton more damage if you are weakened enough so not only evelynn can bypass resistances and health stacking from tanks unlike other assassins she has a much easier time finishing them off once they are weakened enough this invalidates tanks as a form of counterplay against evelynn

evelynn is just broken but people somehow refuse to admit that she is they say that she is balanced easily counterable telegraphed that only low elo players die to her none of this is true as i explained

also evelynn needs nerfs but for some reason riot refuses to nerf her why",Champion Design

gt 
gt runes were taking first strike down a bit more than it was before benefits disproportionately from longer games and phase rush is a bit strong after weve seen the other rune changes play out

"to start of im just gonna come out and say it im a jungle main so if you wish to take this post as simply crying be my guest

now this 1320 patch was basically intended to make jungle less op and make junglers not the main character of the game

not to be too egocentric here but isnt jungle arguably the hardest role in the game to execute on an actual good level so im just wondering shouldnt it be like the hardest role in the game is also the strongest role if done correctly no

but okay if we dont want jungle to be the main characters of the game that still are the ones who gank lanes track enemy jungler secure objectives etc then who do we want the main characters of the game to be

players who are browsing reddit are engaged more than rest of the player base same with watching youtube or twitter i dont know if you remember but sometimes there are justifications for some changes to a champion like olaf with ult change a while back many more with most recent being jinx those changes are made to not buff the champions power in particular but to make their fantasy stronger for the player so i wonder why are some champions allowed on the rift while others are stuck in the basement take for example jinx her power fantasy for most players would be her aoe rockets and crazy speed from passive jinx being a pro issue in the past zeri power fantasy for most zeri players would be her aoe and speed steroid from ult zeri being pro issue too both are similar in their fantasy but with different conditions jinx needing to score takedown while zeri has to stay in combat otherwise she runs out of juice so how come one champion is praised to the sky being arguably broken right now and the other had her knee caps broken with a sledgehammer,Champion Design

"hi im jack j i work fulltime on ai in competitive gaming and so have access to a lot of solo queue data today i decided to write an article for one simple purpose

finding nrg palafoxs genius in his kr solo queue data

tomorrow 19th october 2023 the lcs champions nrg face the lpl 4th seed weibo gaming in the first round of the league of legends world championship

its far too easy to be an na doomist i mean given their record and all however sometimes all you need is a little hope today that hope has come in the form of an offhand comment by xiaohu the wiebo midlaner who described palafox his opposite number in nrg as powerful and seems like a genius

yes this was later more accurately translated to be closer to talented with potential but as i say today is all about spreading the hopium

now i wont be jumping immediately to and so nrg will probably win worlds instead im simply going to try and fuel the fire my fuel in this case is a st tonne of korean solo queue data alongside a desire to answer a very simple question what makes palafox a genius

before we get into the detail heres a quick explanation of the data

data preliminaries

 all data comes from korean solo queue
 a special thank you to trackingtheproshttpswwwtrackingtheproscom who provide me with the solo queue account names
 i am writing this on the 18th october the data on the site below refreshes regularly and so will therefore not match exactly
 statistics are calculated from the players last 50 games to be best reflective of their current elo
 all statistics are adjusted by the players champion pool they are therefore reflective of the player and how they perform above or below the average for their champions
 when quoting percentiles they are being compared to all master accounts not just other professional players
 killsdeaths in the last 10 seconds of a game fountain dives mostly are removed as to not punish regular forfun fountain diving therefore some games will not match exactly what is quoted in a players match history
 you can see all data here itero korean solo queue statisticshttpswwwiteroggprostatistics

now on with the question what makes palafox a genius

i have over 500 statistics to deal with but to start let us keep it simple he currently sits at a respectable 766lp from an impressive 441 games this puts him ahead of his lane opponent but admittedly hes had a few more games to get there

lp and games in kr solo queue 2023httpspreviewredditkbioqcd2dzub1pngwidth462ampformatpngampautowebpamps7b101d5dbc73ae1c2532b2f714d91815cd3e06b6

his champion pool is also by most comparisons fairly normal no sign of his genius just yet

palafoxs recent champion poolhttpspreviewredditcabxdf7bdzub1pngwidth773ampformatpngampautowebpamps31fc5403df56d8c13683200cc9fdea9e3156f5f3

having spent the last hour studying his solo queue data in an almost stalkerish level of detail there was one theme that stood out among all others

palafox is the kda king

 overall kdahttpspreviewredditi8ye5jfedzub1pngwidth462ampformatpngampautowebpamps55df5f6430152fb5acfda7159456689ca91b824f

remember all stats are adjusted by the champion pool his raw average is lower but he constantly overperforms on kda when compared to other high ranked players who play similar champions

there were several components that makeup his overall kda that stoodout to me

 kda against his lane opponent
 kda in the jungleriver and the impact on objective control
 kd in solo bolos

 kda against his lane opponent

kills  assists on midlanershttpspreviewredditauej9nihdzub1pngwidth497ampformatpngampautowebpamps61249e5ec9295fa803452b40f3af9272e6780d0e

lets start with his kills  assists against midlaners although hes in the bottom third of the elo since solo queue mavericks tend to play riskier than pros he remains competitive with more comparable opponents like g2 caps and xiaohu  faker being an outlier for his passiveness in lane

his genius however may best be seen when you use the above in conjunction with his deaths to midlaners

deaths to midlanershttpspreviewreddit090jpn5ldzub1pngwidth462ampformatpngampautowebpampsce29ff3f7663a7f73c2b3beda5e29093594882e0

xiaohu is killing midlaners at a rate of 33 a game but dying to them at the exact same rate whilst caps is even dying more than he kills them palafox manages to get 34 kills or assists a game on his fellow midlaners whilst only dying to them 23 times a master class in controlled aggression

kda in the jungle amp river

the second component is his kda specifically whilst inside the jungle and river usually these happen during team fights and skirmishes around key objectives like heralds and dragons

kda in the jungle  riverhttpspreviewreddit054bdd0odzub1pngwidth514ampformatpngampautowebpamps40776538c72759ba162891df05a5f565f57dc65c

for this one i use a slightly different statistic than normal rather than looking at a kda ratio i instead add up all his kills  assists in the jungle and take away his deaths

the conclusion is really selfexplanatory palafox seems to just be better than xiaohu at team fights in the jungle i really cant be budged on this conclusion sorry

you may also be wondering given his absolute dominance in jungle team fighting do his teams tend to secure more dragons and heralds

net dragons amp net baronshttpspreviewreddit6v0mohz0ezub1pngwidth796ampformatpngampautowebpampsebd0612340b191ecd96759c23e2fa47c7c8b2443

again i use a slightly different metric here rather than looking at the raw amount of monsters killed i look at the net value if your team takes it you get 1 if the enemy takes it you get 1 and if no one took it you get 0

data note i include dragonsheralds that the player did not directly assist with since there are plenty of ways of helping your team secure an objective without needing to be directly involved

with palafoxs exceptional jungle team fighting he is able to help his team secure dragons and heralds far above the average and certainly above xiaohu

solobolo kd differential

as our final statistic let us now look at how many solobolos he averages per game and how that compares to his solobolo deaths

solo bolos kdshttpspreviewreddit7hktw6k3ezub1pngwidth796ampformatpngampautowebpampsc1c3ae835a279ac1419b06be940a61af471b21c7

if you look closely at the table you can quite quickly see that nrg are going to beat weibo tomorrow at this point its a mathematical fact xiaohu is only managing 139 solo kills a game but is getting solo killed 127 times our boy palafox not only manages to get more solo kills 148 hes also doing it whilst being solo killed considerably less 081

to conclude

through my research and writing of this brief solo queue analysis i have become increasingly confident that nrg will be beating weibo tomorrow this will come almost exclusively through an absolute monstrous midgap which will unfold a little like this

 xiaohu in a desperate attempt to show his prowess will make a number of failed plays against palafox who will happily take the free kill or assist whilst safely farming his lane
 around the 810 minute mark both teams will collapse around herald where nrg will emerge victorious after an almost flawless team fight from their midlanerhuffs the last tin of copium
 although nrg are ahead at this point its not until a monstrous solo bolo from palafox onto xiaohu and the subsequent baron does the game become a complete onesided stomp followed by a 27minute final push

"what is the point of ranks nowadays if mmr is the only factor on matchmaking

ive seen this posted a couple of times on the sub but im genuinely curious what the consensus on ranks is at this point on the sub

been playing for a while and i understand why the matchmaking system was changed from visible mmr to visible ranks with hidden mmr to reduce ranked anxiety and people camping at mmr cutoffs but as far as i can tell visible rank always had an influence on hidden mmr up until recently where they made it so visible ranks are defacto useless 

personally i feel like in the spot that ranked is currently ranked anxiety can only have gotten worse than it ever was when visible mmr existed and i very much doubt cutoff camping has gone done significantly 

i mean if a new player loads into the game and sees the opponents he is going up against are 8001000lp above him whether or not their mmr is similar i just cant imagine he is going to be having a good time

if you dont want to read all that the biggest similarity is bezravnis burrowing charge in which he can charge an enemy while underground before exploding out of the earth in a shower of debris and grabbing his target which sounds similar to skarners new charge that plows through terrain thats the only major similarity though as skarner isnt shooting living webs at people or heat rays from his tails

but if we move to the showcased desert scourge skin concept the visual similarities are very apparent this version does have some visuals that distinguish itself from bezravnis though with the metal bits and a general feel of bulkiness with larger stingers and pincers

"for people who dont know banner of command was an item you bought to promote a minion to take  reduced damage from enemy champions and turrets and granted it bonus stats on a 2 minute cooldown it also gave all the gold killed by the minion to its owner

it gave 125 base health regen 60 armor and 30 mr and cost 2200 gold  riot removed banner of command because well the item influenced a terrible meta where people bought it just for pushing and would make a team to protect the cannon minion from getting killed either by poking away the enemy team or making sure they couldnt walk up to do anything at all about the minion

ampx200b

introducing hullbreaker this item gives while no allied champs are nearby 2060 armor and magic resistance depending on level which is amazing stats and you deal 20 more damage to towers not even adding to the fact that you indirectly buff your large minion it can be a super minion 60180 armormagic resistance and it deals 200 increased damage to towers

not even accounting for the rest of the stats it gives the champion which include  300 hp 150 base health regen 60 ad and a 5 movement speed buff

this item is literally a buffed banner of command because it can be built on any champion who has the mobility to get away or 1v1 or even 2v1 with the item and completely shifts the game state over to who has the best hullbreaker champ or who has a hullbreaker champ

how did riot even think this item is balanced in any way just considering a soloq standpoint where you have 0 communication the item has overbuffed stats and if your team cant match the push or somehow end the game before the top laner gets the item it will be a nuisance all game until you somehow win or more than likely lose

there was a reason banner of command was taken out of the game and that was because it was a toxic item that forced teams into either having it or somehow countering it which with the introduction of hullbreaker seems even easier than actually stopping a hullbreaker champ",Bad Teammates
"any other top laners using swap picks to get 5th pick most games i was having a hard time climbing because i like picks that have some nasty counters like riven or some other melee champs that are feast or famine

so lately my desire to win has been greater than my desire to play x champ so every preselect i ask for 5th pick include heart emojis and also sometimes i use ladder swapping so if im 1st pick i swap for 3rd pick then once im 3rd pick 4th doesnt mind swapping then 5th pick

ampx200b

my win rate has gone from 44 to 54 in the past few weeks with some 164 wl streaks its extremely effective but only if you know how to play most top laners and esp in platgoldsilver so if youve been playing league for some years and like to play all the champs this is a perfect strategy for you

ampx200b

i basically just counter pick the strongest counters to my enemy top laner only tough situations are if you dont get last pick top infrequently lately for me or if they have flex picks even including those two limiting factors they dont seem to effect me much

ampx200b

im stomping every lane and my skill hasnt gotten better just by counterpicking top the only guideline i use is the champ has to be in the top 3 lane winners its kind of dumb honestly how easy every game is now

ampx200b

i have a spreadsheet with who my counters are

if they pick aatrox i lock in ireliaolaf they pick camille i lock in wwrenektonteemo

darius kennenteemovolipantheonjayce

fiora wwgprenektonsett

olaf akalitrundledariussett

nasus voliilloairenekton

teemo naafiricassolafyasuoirelia

garen a really fun one ap varus wbarrier camille akshan

ampx200b

i assume once i hit like diamond this strategy will have diminishing returns because some one tricks will be able to play their champ better then me but its really turned around my league experience completely the only qualification to this strat is that youve been playing for a long time and are one of those i have 2030 games on every champ kinda player or know how these matchups go

ampx200b

its way way easier than knowing how a skill matchup goes when olaf is lvl 4 and jayce is lvl 4 both with ignite you completely subvert that because in most of these matchups its closer to a hard counter again at least in platgoldsilver so you win most trades

even if i play badly i still beat garen with varus or camille or beat nasus with volibear or teemo with naafiricass or olaf with akali so even though im a bit rusty on these champs it doesnt matter because the matchup is so good really great for lowmid mmr players

"i might be a niche part of the player base but hear me out 

let me start with im part of the sad regions that do not have normal draft so if quick play straight up removes blind pick i will not have a ranked option on summoners rift apart from quick play 

im one of those players who plays fill in normals and likes to match my champ to my team comp i play most roles equally as badly so it doesnt really matter  however quick play taking over blind pick seems quite worrying for me the whole shtick of my friend group is we are all fill players and depending on the mood we all swap out our roles and champs or play with knowledge of what our new guest friend is picking 

 quick play may remove this from my friend group and we usually play as a group of 3 and 4 so playing ranked flex isnt a consistent thing to do i can play soloq when playing alone  

this wouldnt be an issue if there was any other normal play mode but saying it will completely replace blind pick is quite worrying for me will smaller regions only have quick play  or will smaller regions finally have two normal modes",Bad Teammates

as of now the top 11 junglers are all ap except for briarj4 who are both ludicrously overtuned balls of stats and because j4 only needs level 23 to be relevant also note that j4 has been broken for the entire year hitting 54 after goredrinkershojin buffs then receiving nerfs and graves because he has aoe and pet damage scales with armor which he stacks using his e true grit stacks during clears

notably rammus is fucking stupid with the new changes because not only does he build a thornmail first pet aoe dmg scales off 20 armor stacking but his kit makes passivew do damage scaling with armor so he builds full armor and clears faster than a full ad jungler building only damage with no downside

as of 1320 apcarry junglers have the fastest clear

but stupidly tank junglers also clear faster than addamage junglers now before there was a tradeoff to pick a tank vs picking an addamage jungler generally tank junglers clear slower because they have much stronger teamfighting and cc for ganks now they have greatly buffed the armormr scaling of the pets to the point that tank junglers actually clear the same speed if not faster than ad damage junglers so they not only clear faster but they have better ganks cc and teamfighting so there isnt any point to pick addamage junglers anymore and the stats reflect this

one of the biggest complaints with yuumi derives from how shes able to support her adc without any punishment theres no good way to catch out a yuumi and kill her without her adc dying or her hoping off at the wrong point which again riot has removed any reason to

yuumi as she is now has low base stats low attack range and poor scalings if riot wants yuumi to be played in at least soloq they need to incentivize hoping off and disincentivize just sticking onto one person i understand the previously it felt bad for the adc when yuumi would just go and stick onto the bruiser and leave everyone else to die while shes hitting e every 5 seconds to give a massive heal

some ways to incentivize hoping off is having her abilities operate differently while detached having yuumi apply a limited timed buff that refreshes when she hops offswaps between allies buffing her attack range something like 550600 or buffing her base stats 

so i ask again what is the expectation of yuumi from all parties as she is now she isnt balanced and wont be balanced in her current state i also reject the notion that her w is unbalanceable or any ability for that matter her w doesnt exist in a vacuum she has 4 other abilities and 4 teammates",Bad Teammates
"im an otp renata player and thanks to her ive just reached diamond yesterday after 11 years playing this game 

ofc im gonna say she is a great champion and super strong but id like to know what people think of her 

shes not very popular has a low pick rate so i want to understand why people dont play her more and why she isnt that popular  because i do think that the champion itself her  design and lore  is really top tier and i think mostly everybody agrees riot have made a great job creating her 

so what is your thought on renata glasc",Champion Design

" i just played my first varus game of the patch so i didnt notice sooner that they snuck in change for varus q indicator that was not mentioned in the patch notes together with the range indicator there is now also a projectile indicator normally i dont really mind those kinds of changes but this indicator is really really distracting to me because you have to channel the spell and its there for the full duration like i said things like this normally dont bother me but this is quite a bad qol change in my opinion it doesnt look that bad in the picture but when you play the champ it just feels so off and distracting maybe there is a chance they revert it if not this is actually a thing that sadly would make me not want to play varus

"everyone is frustrated at the ping changes and there is record of the rioter who announced the change feeding in a game when their teammate spam pinged them alive at the end of the game

recently khazix who is struggling in the jungle had their buffs seemingly pulled from the upcoming patch with no reason given

its just odd as someone else pointed out that people like phreak who are known for giving super detailed reasoning behind changes made big or small has been super vague and basically just said jungle op so we nerf as reasoning for such a huge change to an entire role

"i mean just off the top of my head brand zyra ashe previously fiddlesticks previously morgana zilean swain previously lux karma kinda not really idk xerath and velkoz thats eleven champions who were not originally designed as supports or who were not originally designed to be primarily supports who have received balance changes specifically to appeal to support players and or to balance them for the lane including seraphine who is slated for tweaks this upcoming patch that makes twelve champions

ampx200b

seriously its a mystery to me how ivern has managed to avoid this treatment

ampx200b

when other champions start seeing too much play in any other lane theyre almost always nerfed right away especially if it is a support going into another lane pyke mid karma midtop sona top and bot janna top seraphine bot camille jungle kalista top etc all of these are other examples of champions seeing viability in other lanes who were then forcefully taken out of those lanes why is that not okay but seraphine who is an absolutely awful support gets moved into support because people decided they wanted to play her there

ampx200b

am i salty because seraphine mid is probably effectively dead in the water next patch absolutely i am a support player and honestly im sick of seeing random cheese show up in the role only for it to be accommodated to but when supports show up in other roles its almost always swifty nerfed i mean seriously how many supports have undergone a lane swap that has received serious attention allowing them to stay there kench maybe morgana jungle maybe brand his winrate is 2 higher midlane i guess its still sub 50

ampx200b

a new support comes out and theyre basically plastered with little kinks that prevent them from ever seeing play in any lane other than support because the champion design team is absolutely terrified of renata glasc making an appearance in mid lane but theyre just fine with turning every other artillery mage into a support its seriously a miracle neither zoe or taliyah have been reworked into supports at this point considering their overall aestetic",Champion Design
"hey everyone

i wanted to do a fun fanmade short story for the coveneclipse universe as its my favourite skin line when i first saw the asol art for suneatereclipse knight in lor and the coven skins that came out recently on lor and lol it inspired me to come up with this story youre about to read i hope some or all of you enjoy the read again its meant to be short and sweet and hopefully the actual coven amp eclipse knights story gets explored some more in the future along with some more skins

 tseison

 the great resurrection  a coven short story

the great resurrection had been halted for too long the coven of the south led by evelynn was busy fighting against sivir and her eclipse knights the coven of the west led by queen morgana was engaged in dealing with the suneater kayles awakening the coven of the east led by syndra was dealing with two unexpected problems nami and jannas disappearance and nilahs betrayal the great war continued to rage on and the support from the witches old gods remained scarce because the slumbering god queen did not create enough of them before she was sealed away in the forgotten temple

now there are whispers of the eclipse knights close to summoning their great deity the suneater aurelion sol to bring an end to the witches and old gods in this final last stand thus it was up to the coven of the north led by illaoi and the god queens prophet who entrusted her to carry her eye to resurrect her and turn the tides of this great war

the forgotten temple was a hidden structure located on top of mount aveth where the texts of the great resurrection and witchcraft were first transcribed along with it being the prison of the first old god the god queen belvethcreator of all her old god spawns and mother to all witches that harness her primordial magic

with no word from the other covens and permission from queen morgana illaoi gwen karma and neeko set out to accomplish belveths greatest task before the eclipse knights and their sun eater god arrived

upon entering the temple the walls were engraved with ancient spells theyd never heard of before and primordial magic resonated out of each of them neeko attempted to place her hand on one of the scribes but the touch magically burned her mind until karma pulled her back to reality as powerful as the four of them may be this magic was beyond their comprehension even for the likes of neeko

up ahead was a statue of belveth in her human form sitting on a throne heavily guarded by eclectic powerful enchantments from chains runes and an impenetrable barrier well at least not in illaois eyes as illaoi held the eye of her god in front of her it began to glow within moments four giant spiritual vines manifested and wrapped themselves around the barrier slowly constricting it until cracks started to appear then without hesitation all four of the vine tentacles combined into one and came crashing down upon the barrier shattering it and causing it to dissipate

it was karmas turn next to handle the runes but it wasnt as simple as waving her hands and hand gesturing them away each rune had to be dispelled individually but as intuitive and powerful as she was she could find the flaws in every enchantment she encountered with a focused resolve and a short window of time she tethered one rune to the others and collapsed them all at once

the chains were next an easy obstacle for gwen to overcome but with a snip and another snip of her giant enchanted scissors against them they wouldnt break illaoi tried her hand at the chains to break them with physical strength but nothing worked gwen took a moment to ponder the chains until an idea struck

she then hurled a needle at each of the chains four corners and began to chant channelling her powers through her giant scissors within moments a dome of mist enveloped the statue and chains she stepped into the mist and became ethereal holding her scissors to the chains again she snipped it and it immediately broke she repeated this action on the other three until they all were gone stepping out of the vanishing dome of mist she looked at neeko as she was nervously standing beside karma awaiting her turn

as confident as they were in neeko and her great power neeko was still anxious about pulling off what was required of her next but her sisters reassured her that she was doing this for all of their sisters who were hunted and killed and she would be the final key in speaking the text of the great resurrection engraved on belveths statue illaoi gave neeko her idol she nodded and as she slowly walked up to the statue her form shifted to that of queen morgana the voice they needed to unlock the final enchantment that bound belveth illaois idol condensed into a smaller size and neeko placed their gods eye into the statues forehead as she began to speak the words the others could sense the air becoming heavy and cold just from outside the tomb illaoi karma and gwen went to uncover what it was

reaching the lobby of the temple to the right of them was a shattered oversized gold mirror the pieces of glass on the ground suddenly pieced themselves together and reformed the mirror it started to glow and within moments stepping out of the mirror was the coven of the west lissandra camille zyra and leblanc

to the left of them a clawlike slash through space appeared and savagely opening the tear wider emerged the coven of the south evelynn cassiopeia ashe and ahri soon after a giant flock of black ravens crashed into the lobby grounds and revealed the coven of the east syndra akali and elise

illaoi and her coven were pleased to see the rest of their sisters still alive and well but the absence of nilah nami and janna piqued their curiosity news of nilahs betrayal and new allegiance to the eclipse knights was unfolded nami and janna however had set off on their pilgrimage to seek greater power to help the witches in the great war and knowledge of their whereabouts continues to be clouded

pleasantries were cut short by the arrival of a dark owl that descended before them just as it landed and transformed appearing amongst them was queen morgana displeased with how reckless the others have become and the secrets others have been keeping her irritation flourished even more at the sound of her voice coming from deep within the hallway to belveths tomb

deep down morgana never wanted to follow through with the great resurrection and knew if beveth returned her title as queen of all covens would be relinquished and she insisted on handling the war in her own way she immediately took to her owl form and went through the catacombs to stop neeko

the moment she arrived and transformed back to her human form she lashed out at neeko with a blast of dark energy but neeko was quickly shielded against it by karma who intervened as the others suddenly arrived in the tomb morgana was seconds away from embracing her true form and dispatching all those who would try to stop her but she was too late and with the last bit of the ritual spoken neeko had succeeded the statue quickly shattered and with it the resurrection of the god queen belveth was complete

belveths human form was benevolent to them all and magically adorned itself in garments she was depicted as extremely beautiful with long white hair pale grey skin and glowing violet eyes an elaborate black and goldcoloured gown manifested onto her body and a crown formed on her head black and red ravens emerged from the magical walls one by one and collided with her back creating a long cloak of feathers

all the witches bowed before belveth all of them except morgana unfortunately she addresses her god queen so poorly but belveth doesnt think much of it as she relishes her return and the breath of life once more before words could be exchanged between the two queens a loud sonic scream shook the temple causing the pillars and ceiling to collapse karma quickly acted and shielded them all from the rubble

but suddenly a shower of stars fell from the night sky and collided with the shield pressuring it to collapse but karma not once showed any signs of wavering that was until a spark of moonlight fired into the temple and destroyed her shield as the dust cleared the witches headed for the entrance and upon reaching it waiting at their doorstep stood the eclipse knights high priestesses lux soraka and seraphine

the witches laughed amongst themselves as the three stood no match against them and the might of their god queen belveth but it soon became no laughing matter as their leaders leona and diana suddenly appeared with aatrox senna sivir nilah sejuani fiora irelia rell and the army of the eclipse knights waiting just at the bottom of the temple

this would be the last stand for the witches this time they knew there was no more running no more hiding and no more gods to call upon belveth began to chuckle as her voice reverbed throughout her temple and she soon began to ascend higher up into the sky as her body started to distort and change into her true form the enormous and monstrous being floated above the temple and glanced down upon the puny eclipse knights that appeared as mere ants beneath her feet

with her third eye  she noticed in the distance a fierce storm making its way towards the temple and hidden within that storm were janna and the thousand pierced volibear at her side as the armies of the elderwood continued to cross the bridge of the murky waterways bordering the elderwood to assist their fellow eclipse knight allies here they were suddenly stopped by the emergence of nami and her giant sea creature the leviathan

their armies were no match against belveth and her followers this time they had come so far only to fail but her attention was quickly drawn elsewhere as the suneater kayle and with her the suneater aurelion sol were descending from the cosmic reaches of space the end of the great war had finally begun

one problem im encountering very often and i dont know how to overcome is actually being able to use my lead to win us games because my team refuse to tank damage and let me pop off

so lets say im 70 destroyed my lane but lets say another couple of lanes on my team have hard lost standard scenario i know im in a position to carry the game im turning up and pinging objectives knowing crucial team fights are likely to break out my insert front line top laner or jungler here are watching the enemy team take drakebaron theyre moving back and fourth with no purpose im pinging assistance inside the drake pit to tell them to go in it literally doesnt matter if they die i know with my superior positioning mechanics and gold advantage i can win us the team fight and objective all the while im waiting safely around the corner waiting to twitch q my way into the fight once its begun and crucial cc abilities from the enemy are used

but no my front liner doesnt want to go in instead watches them take the objective front row cinema ticket before the enemy team collapse onto my front liner and just explode him before i can even help by this point nobody else is even around bc theyve run away after seeing the objective has been taken its either a 5v2 with my front liner which i really dont wanna do no matter how fed i am and the bounty i have or we just never get to fight

i think that there is some lowhanging fruit that riot is missing out on and i was wondering what others people had champions who could jungle with minor tweaks feel different to play than current junglers and would be healthy for the game as a whole

chogath all he needs is an increase in his monster cap on his e at rank 1 the 3 max health damage caps at a measly 60 damage  which even slows down his first clear as the level 1 buffs have 23k health without the cap hed do 9 more damage per e  27 more damage per cast while the caps are really designed to prevent champs from taking down objectives too quick while chos ult is great during smite fights the more common tank build is actually really bad at taking down objectives quickly most of his damage comes from ult amp  health on his e

a change on his cap from 6020rank to maybe 10020stack would speed up his first couple clears to be semicompetitive still on the slow side and average at objectives nothing else in his kit would need to change

i think chogath jungle would be healthy for the game since while he has 3 ccs and an execute his lack of gapclosers or any movement keeps him from being too annoying to play against when 23 of his ccs and his execute are closerange and the third is telegraphed unlike if lissandra was made a viable jungler as phreak mentioned

gromps max hp was increased from 4100 to 48175 what is the reason  from a technical standpoint  to have its hp be such a specific number why isnt it 4820 or 4818 some other jungle monsters also have a max hp stat with a decimal and some have clean numbers such as 2820 or 1175 what could be the reason for this,Bad Teammates

"about every wednesday morning in na riot does maintenance on their servers  now i understand this is necessary and is not a problem but what is a problem is how this maintenance is extended essentially every single time  i am typically up early so i see the planned time when servers are supposed to return  sometimes the servers will go up an hour later or sometimes three hours later than planned but never on time  

my message to riot is to be conservative with your estimates on when you will complete maintenance  it is better to have maintenance set to last longer but to have the servers up earlier than to continually miss the predicted time servers will return",Bad Teammates

"in the past few weeks me and a few friends been dabbling into some other games and came into our attention on why games like league wild rift and dota 2 have features like   


 more in depth playerchampion stats
 pregame item purchase
 characterskin 3d model visualization
 maprift customization
 better player profile customization
 custom announcer packs

but pc league has a lackluster version of these or not even even that   


wild rift that is made by riot has really cool looking animated and interactive champion 3d models that you can examine but this is non existent on pc league dota 2 customization of your game is miles ahead of league with custom vo for announcers rn during the international they have several announcer packs from casters and community members from different regions to purchase map skins ui skins custom profile layouts and so on and the amount of stats data that you can access in dota 2 is immense in comparison  


im aware that league has way more pressing issues with its serviceclient that need to be addressed first for example its been almost 800 days and the br server still has account transfers blocked but my question is   


with the large amount of funding that riot has enough to fund multiple games wild rift legends of runeterra tft league stories games project l league mmo etc hollywood level production of shows arcane arcane season 2 musical productions with several famous artists lil nas x new jeans twice gidle imagine dragons etc then why when it comes to its main core game they seem to not add new features its taken multiple years for them to allow us to choose a different language of the client in league this is coming in november qol and customization stuff that riot themselves implemented to its other games under the same ip

if you assume every team will beat all the teams ranked worse than them and lose to every team ranked better there is still a 50 chance of one of the top 8 teams not making it through if you introduce some random chance to the matches so they arent 100 determined by strength ranking the chance of one of the top 8 teams not making it goes up so the true chance of an upset is gt50

so theres a pretty good chance of one of g2 fnc c9 or whatever team you think is just below top 8 making it through even if they cant beat the best teams some hopium for the western fans going into the swiss stage

"hello besties as you may know riot is buffing seraphine support as part of these changes they are reducing her scaling and giving her more early power  which is like you know kinda against her hyperscaling fantasy buuuuut i can accept it a bit so long as we remain a scaling champ but phreak has clearly outlined that they are fine if seraphine mid stops existing as collateral damage since she has a super low lt050 pr in most elos so basically nonexistant already

hohohoewever i think this is a good moment to address the elephant in the room swain

over the years swain support his most loyal fanbase has gotten nothing but changes that helped midlane and top because of incessant whining from mid and top the roles that basically had no playrate right now his pr is at a whooping 1 after what 2 3 jhins funny number of mini reworks

and thats where the changes landed

well no sir i say no sir

we in the support role lost our super cool pull whenever enemy is cc for these mid fans clamoring for mages to hardly even play him anyway and forcing swain into a perpetual 50 wr of oh he is viable not super good tho just because they whined and now dont even want to use him and after all this they still complain about oh i would totally use him you dont get it i actually love swain and wish him to be viable except he is right there he is literally standing there drinking a margarita in midlane waiting for you to come inside his loving embrace and you are just there dumbfounded saying nu uh

wtf 

meanwhile supps playerbase has only grown over the years rising to a near 5pr because we support chads love our draco malphoys dad whose name i cant remember looking ahh crow daddy who probably gives good hugs i say if they dont want him give it to support players again reintroduce cc pull on ally and give him mk scorpions get over here anytime he uses it

how we won kaisa continued to just click r whenever i clicked r to farm first strike gold she aced them a few times like that eventually enemy got smart and killed her it seemed like they would finally turn the tides and destroy our base

"anybody piloting this champion with both hands can take over the entire game

she has three modifiers in aram including 5 damage dealt 5 damage taken and 30  healing this is compounded by her passive which increases healing by up to 50 based on missing health and further boosted by spirit visage or revitalise

 i understand that the majority of players will kill themselves due to berserk but later in the game unless your team has infinite cc to stop her w and enough burst to kill her in between es both of which heal her for a ridiculous amount it becomes comically difficult for her to die so long as shes pressing buttons in the general direction of the enemy team

"kayn

  kayn already has an indicator for his e but it shows only either his full duration length or the reduced length while there is already an audio cue thats played when his e runs out due to not being in a wall i think a visual clarification via an indicator could also help

 i think similarly an outofchampioncombatindicator could help so that you arent suprised when you directly exit the wall  maybe for this and the previous point there could also be an elegant solution which i dont see

ampx200b

 on the vision of e i feel lt is unintuitive for enemies that he just has a vision radius around him when inside a wall and can thus see over other walls he isnt inside off i dont think you can see his shadowball inside the wall through fow so the enemies dont know that he sees them either walls could proberly block vision or the enemies could be notified wth eyes over their head

ampx200b

  expanding on the point of vision in e it can be confusing for kayn himself to understand that he doesnt get vision in bushes during e same for zoe ult  normaly bushes you dont have vision of throw a shadow onto themselfes however since for kaynzoe during er bushes dont throw a shadow it looks as if you have vision inside even though you dont  i understand that at least for kayn if bushes would throw shadows his vision inside some walls would get severely nerfed  but one could also try to implement that the bushes dont apear as bright

"teleport is basically does the exact thing on mid lane that it did on top lane before unleashed teleport was introduced 

adressing teleport for the early game should have happened last patch when death timers changed but they didnt change the tp mechanic for early game 

its the same top lane situation you are not getting punished for being solokilled early levels but ot rather gives you a favor you can die and tp back to mid lane on a good wave state and get the goldfreeze in this form if you pick ignite for mid you are trolling 

this type of gameplay design favors mages which i would hav nothing against as a mage player but it honestly feels unfair and removes the fun element of playing mid lane the excitement and the challenge 

surely if you go smurf into irongold this wont be as problematic but if you play high enough you will understand how this is the same scenario before unleashed tp as top laners just died winner pushed lane while the 010 guy just used tp to get back to lane and set up a permanent freeze

"over the past 6 months ive been compiling all of my normal draft games over time i started seeing 2 distinct trends over 80 of all of my games consists of premade groups of at least 3 but more often 45 roughly 60 of my games contains a player at least 2 entire tiers above my entire team 

this has created an environment of complete one sided stomps in the rarity that my team is the premade or the higher ranked player my team then does the stomping even games are extremely rare

at first i gave the benefit of the doubt for this situation maybe my mmr was high maybe i was toxic and got in a group of other toxic players maybe all this stems from the past when all my friends used to play together the issue is all that has been over with for a long time im now back to honor 4 and have cut all the things i used to do to get restricted on this account my friends stopped playing over a year ago and ive been solo since

so my next thought was okay maybe our normal mmr just matches their normal mmr that would make a lot of sense if i saw these platemeralddiamond players playing an off role or a champion they werent used to however more often than not not only is this not the case but they are usually on one tricks or very high mastery champions

now for the interesting part i made an alternate account specifically to one trick a champion for ranked without having all the ranked anxiety on my main account the result games like league used to be back and forth leads with interesting fights and a lot of skirmishes no one sided stomps or toxic one tricks that are 123 tiers higher than our team everyone genuinely working together to win all the 5 man cheese coming out of a random bush is gone no more breathing in the jungle and 17 people showing up

ive put a lot of games in over the past 6 months and no matter what i do it shows no sign of improving this leads me to believe my main account has some sort of flag or issue with it to cause this kind of setting

is anyone else getting the same circumstance if so how widespread is this problem its frustrating as a silver player to queue up and get a 5 stack with 2 plat one tricks on it absolutely wiping the floor with me and my team what can be done to fix this if it is a widespread issue will this issue persist in riots new blind pick replacement mode",Bad Teammates

not to be too egocentric here but isnt jungle arguably the hardest role in the game to execute on an actual good level so im just wondering shouldnt it be like the hardest role in the game is also the strongest role if done correctly no

but okay if we dont want jungle to be the main characters of the game that still are the ones who gank lanes track enemy jungler secure objectives etc then who do we want the main characters of the game to be

"just noticed that riot found some funky insert bad word here inside jaxs old code so of course they had to change itthey need to have everything refreshed and new to rerelease the grandmaster at arms

so now jaxs ingredients are

 invisible counterstrike
 random non existent w damage
 counterstrike dealing no damage if you recast it
 ultimate passive randomly not playing its animation
 w never playing its animation
 voice filter for god staff and empyrean randomly not playing
 mecha kingdoms basic attack animations are ruined
 counterstrike dodge interaction not working anymore with some matchups they worked before

fixes for some of them for next patch only when he is the novelty of 1320

imo they should just revert to the old code since it was perfect

"i am plat adc playing for 15 years mostly kaisa so i guess gold from every other year i know im not great just enjoy playing mobas

my understanding of the lane is that it is the supports job to enable allies to get gold and contribute with low econ to the team with vision and cc or buffs  

i tend to get annoyed when i get a support like swain who i feel is usually playing for themself trying to carry the game and mostly relies on the opposing lane playing poorly getting caught in his really slow cc

i get told i have main character syndrome and yes i feel that the best way to win usually is to play through bot and dragon stack but i dont expect mid and jgl to help my lane a ton every game and understand jgl weaksiding me and play my best and only mention if they harass me about performance  but i dont understand queuing as support and not playing with the goal of enabling your adcteam and playing for yourself

am i right to be annoyed at a support playing for themself or is it my job to try and be an enabler for them

"hullbreaker is currently breaking most elos and it needs to be addressed imo

nobody likes facing hullbreaker nobody likes playing with hullbreaker even the people who are abusing it probably dont like it and would split anyway it is the most game defining item in the entire roster more so than any mythic could even dream of being it promotes a boring toxic and shallow play style for all 10 players and requires the enemy team to play much much better than the hullbreaker team to stand a chance 

you can argue all the points for gives toplane agency reward for weakside or against ridiculous gold efficiency ridiculous winrates toxic playstyle but it doesnt matter it absolutely destroys the league experience for everyone involved

this got 10 times worse with the snowball reductions so it is so much harder to punish interested to read some other opinions because as a bot side player it feels impossible to win if enemy toplaner wins and builds that item",Bad Teammates

you have a special playstyle and like to limit test a lot do you ever get flamed or inted by your team in soloq

oh yeah it happens a lot you have teammates who go play like 50 games a day then theyre just burned out they feel like i am inting but they dont say it because they are chat restricted right so they bait ping me instead

when you became a pro how did your schedule change

hylissong

when i became pro there was a planned schedule on what i should be doing throughout the day when i am playing solo queue when i am having fun when i am going for dinner when i am having gym and when i am having review  all these things planned 

its not spamming games all day long and then you feel like crap going to bed and then the next day is exactly the same

do you see any benefits following the schedule

do you have any advice for people who cant get out of elo hell

hi everyone

i dont normally make these posts but just wanted to share how i feel about the upcoming worlds 2023 as a long time t1 fan

ive watched t1 play since their 2013 debut and have cheered the team on ever since ive been heavily invested in the ups and downs of the team and for the past 2 years its been rough 

the current t1 roster for some reason makes me so emotionally invested despite their potential theyve fell short from earning any international titles

that being said watching the individual videos of t1 players expectations and thoughts on the upcoming championship truly makes me sad it really does feel like regardless of the outcome we will see a change to this roster

all in all i truly wish the best for this team and i will send them my energy for every game of this tournament i know they can be the protagonist for this tournament and truly represent what deft has sad about unbreakable will

"ah another day dawns and what better way to spend it than indulging in my aram addiction featuring my beloved lee sin

i graciously rise from my 29arammarathoninduced slumber at the highly productive hour of 2 am with immense enthusiasm i shout to the heavens another day another triumph in the prestigious aram mode of league of legends

as i click the league of legends icon im greeted by an enigmatic app called riot client  it dares to demand my username and password curiosity piqued i decide to create a fresh account of the day behold leesinsblind is born and it tells me ive successfully signed up in oce a realm i have absolutely no clue about riot games the masterminds behind league of legends mustve recognized my true potential and granted me this unheardof rank

i dive into a brisk warmup aram and what do you know lee sin graces me with his presence to clarify for the less enlightened among you lee sin is a jackofalltrades masterofeverything champion his hidden passive rendering me blind as a bat and not due to any moonshine incident mind you

his q ability is an autotargeted missile that homes in on the nearest adc whether in this game or the next revealing their location and providing me with vital information like their credit score and their mothers relationship status if im not satisfied with their financial health a quick qpress sends them packing wiping their league account and transferring their gold to my offshore bank account

my w ability involves dashing to an ally and shielding them but lets be real shields are overrated when youve already started the game with four death dances and can heal from true damage no big deal

my e well it marks the area around lee sin essentially functioning as an aoe nuke unfortunately it only obliterates nearby champions and provides a meager 300 ingame currency such a pittance i know

and now lee sins pi√®ce de r√©sistance his ultimate r trying to explain it to mere mortals is a task reserved for the elite minds of at least bronze 4 ill demonstrate its incredible power in due course

as the game begins the enemy team quakes in terror at the mere sight of me lee sin who shows no mercy i order them to line up in front of their nexus as their towers and inhibitors have wisely sworn allegiance to my cause their feeble cries fall on deaf ears as i meticulously pass judgment with my q one by one

but this becomes tiresome im already drained from the monumental effort of queuing up so i hit that e button instantly obliterating all players and granting me a handsome stack of gold to purchase my one and only necessary item duskblade of draktharr i even venmo some random ornn player to upgrade it to draktharrs shadowcarver because lets face it im too busy being awesome

the enemy team attempts to surrender realizing their futility against my unparalleled might but i the benevolent lee sin reject their pleas as i eagerly await the airdrop of my new item

at last i decide its time to claim my rightful victory i casually stroll up to the enemy rammus whos rocking a cool 971 armor and press my ultimate at him together we watch in awe as he rockets towards his own nexus shattering their base and presumably his monitor along with it

the victory screen warmly welcomes me and with the profound humility only lee sin can muster i queue up for another exhilarating all random all mid because really why waste time on anything else",Bad Teammates

interesting to see ruler isnt no1 for any of them after seeing that 80 of western analysts had ruler as the best player in the world often phrasing as its not close too also good to see knight being 1st twice and 2nd once after seeing many people putting knight as the 3rd best mid or as low as 5th 6th player overall

i like this list cause it seems they are actually kinda actually basing it off performance this year except the obvious doinb crisp bias often when you ask pro players like the 10 best players they either barely watch games from all major regions or they base it off scrims or who they like more im looking at you evi having apamen as a your top 5 top laner at worlds",Game Balance

"ive always been a bit of a tryhard in league because it was the only game i could play on my shitty laptop at the time and i thought thats just how youre supposed to play to a large extent im still that despite being ok with someone playing off meta picks i still kind of just mentally accepted the loss and moved on i never really understood the appeal i guess 

then i built my current pc which can run basically any game i can think of and i got into elden ring a large part of elden ring content online if youre not into pvp and im def not into elden ring pvp lol is challenge runs with weird builds some of my favourite youtubers are lilaggy and bushy if you want an example of what im talking about when i saw their content i really enjoyed it despite me not liking offmeta stuff in league and i think its because elden ring is pve 

imo the biggest problem with playing offmeta in league is that its a team game and theres always someone who wont be ok with you playing suboptimally because they want to win in the more standard way instead of whatever whacky shenanigans your pick gets up to if youre playing something like idk shack support and your adc has never played with a shaco before the lane is gonna be unnecessarily hard right 

this is why i think league needs a good pve mode like odyssey in 2018 its explicitly for fun and maybe you can even grind it for rewards but the important thing is that its playing against an ai so if you decide to go ap graves or something its no big deal 

urf kinda used to be like this before everyone figured out that adcs were the best role even in urf wow shocker adc is op who could have seen this coming but even that was playing against other people i think we can all agree that being the weird off meta pick in urf and being ahead and cheesing everyone is very fun but being the victim of the offmeta pick and being cheesed makes you want to break your monitor 

what do you guys think would you want an odyssey style pve mode i feel like it would be really good for the game",Bad Teammates

"with the potential leaks of the rift map being changedbaron pit looking different it got me thinking about how in one of the update videos they talked about how in arena they introduced a new terrain type deep water and how they really liked it and want to consider using it for future arena maps i think that if they are changing the rift they are likely or at least should consider using this new terrain type in those changes especially with the elemental drake map changes deep water from the ocean drake makes thematic sense
to keep the purists happy they could leave the base map still and make the drake maps more drastic and should include the deep water

i frequently see people sad about certain mages being pushed out of mid lane because of how the game of league has evolved makes me wonder why we dont see more bot lane apcs i think at this point seraphine and swain prove that its perfectly fine to do you dont really need an adc for objectives anymore since everyone deals so much damage and every role has champions with good single target or attack speed scaling why not take more mages into the bot lane role mages usually scale pretty nicely so why not put them in a place where they have a babysitter that can help them scale and a usually squishy and immobile adc to play around i think more than just seraphine swain and karthus will probably work,Game Balance

"hey guys

im here in peace im in a lol team right now and im having a conversation with my mid laner about trying to play more ranked so he would play theorically better players and improve much more than just aram and scrims once or twice a week and this got me thinking ranked anxiety is a thing very popular and people actually prefer not to play the game even tho they want to get better and there is no real competitive way to do it lp gains and losses affects everyone and theres people who dont really deal well with that so i came up with an idea that i believe might already exist what if we use the lol official discord to create a ladder there the idea is people can have decent games with comms and the rank is measured in the server with wins and losses it doesnt influence lol ranked at all but its a place for people that might prefer to have a proper competitive 5v5 approach rather than going solo with no comms without knowing anything about your mates 

is this a good idea id like to know your guys opinion on this

"jdg take away playmaking mids from knight ban syndra in orianna matchup  pick adcs that can clutch xayah kaisa be toplevel in macro you have to understand that they lose teamfights only via explosive damageclutch plays they know too much about stable slow and steady teamfighting and draft perfectly around that 

phalanx formation around ruler is nigh impossible to beat in bo5 but smashable in bo3 because they always experiment their vanguardsplaymaker champion drafts against the style of a certain team



blg do not overshove your lanes no hittingskirmishes when your hp is lower than them slow down bin if he isnt winning trades  blg slows down completely beat them by tracking where xun is at all times as they need xun to start deathballs and stress out teams 




lng ban scout azir gala kaisaxayah do jdggeng phalanx formation where you protect adc do not do flippy skirmish around gala early as their draft indexes on rolling from the botlane 



wbg ban weiwei rell light kaisa their botlane cannot win in isolation theshy will always give you gank windows because he will always trade his whole philosophy revolves around me higher hp than you we fight because me better pick hard punish champs with a lot of cc to prevent light and xiaohu from having sparks of genius if not draft to smash botlane 



geng draft to run at them draft a composition where if your team has higher hp pools    gt geng will get rolled as much as peanut cheeses the way geng wins is by damage output that inherently means you need to have worldclass draft creativity and hands ban away sejuani 



t1 ban azir xayah no playmaking  play zeri and phalanx protect make t1 play like shit by ganking fakerzeus via teleport timings these two are the mental weakpoints impossible to beat if you dont have a toplaner as good as zeus as they are the best team in the world when zeus is confident but zeus tilts a lot after lost teamfights toplaner and he tunnels on plates and is thus gankable they cannot teamfight as effectively when zeus is dead 



catch keria when hes trying to initiate a fight the danger in lane is keria not guma their jungler will never overperform against top teams because his jungle pathing is the most studied in the east as he always grinds and exposes his pathing in soloq



kt they like setting vision traps everywhere trap them as they are trying to trap you play 4 group  1 split drafts make sure your toplaner can pass the kiin test 



damwon read and adapt in the middle of the game not before what canyon does tells what lane you should smash weak top and botside stay even they get nervous when they are not ahead if you are jdglngt1geng defts brain gets overloaded with macro decisions and cannot shotcall mid game as it is more important to focus on staying alice as adc make simultaneous cross map actions  multiple things happening on the map via skirmish drafts are one of the easy ways to exploit defts role in the team 



g2 an interesting approach is to win is picking offmeta and smashing lane smashing lane is enough to shake how they draft they will respect eastern draft philosophy too much and try to copy it and forget their own style completely forgetting that they just got hands diffed they didnt press their buttons right and overindex on draft 



mad hylissang does not care about the cost of death he only cares about momentum play defensive and trap him your gold will accrue they are inefficient and cannot play slow cannot play slow  throw everyone else gets jebaited easily in teamfights



bds weak early game laning and macro do not flip when taking objectives either phalanx or just avoid fighting and crossmap they will passively lose out via their inefficient macro suffocate with wallets not objective flips 



nrg if youre a top eastern team you probably will know how to download them and get in their heads best teamfighting team in na but na does not know enough about lol to be a threat they lack info will smash you if you try to statcheck them recklessly tho 



tl good at bo1s because they will always draft more damage than you they dont give a fck about balanced compositions more damage  easier to win fights  easier to capitalize on throws 

but since they draft like this they are useless early game smash lane 



c9 adc centric team will probably have issues against jaxgangplank top players as they will always overindex and their botside is afraid to take risks against eastern teams 

start dragon if you are an eastern team it will always be free 

emenes has weak laning form currently exploit 



gam actually drafts better than 75 of the teams but the macro knowledgegame experience may not be there basically will not be able to play from behind vs top tier teams if they are behind they do not know angles  you win easily

"hey everyone 

mordekaisers rework has now been here for about 45 years crazy huh and i wanted to make a fun little thing for everyone to smile and laugh a bit about the wonders this champion brought us before his rework 

for the people who wouldnt know because its been a long while now prerework mordekaiser was by a very long shot the buggiest character in leagues history with over 350 bugs foundhttpswwwredditcomrleagueoflegendscomments8fcwr7and_to_conclude_the_streak_with_over_300_book enough to make a book out of themhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbahjlgsdya4 

some of them were irrelevant and lots of them were impactful but boring but some of his bugs were downright hilarious and so i want to make people recall or discover these beautiful creations 

so heres a trivia quiz on some of mordekaisers best bugs 

ampnbsp

1 what gameplay difference did mordekaisers skins use to make in 2016

 a they gave his ghosts a chance to turn invisible 

 b they gave dragon pets a leash range 

 c they made his vfx visible through fog of war 

 d they doubled his shield generation 

correct answer gtb they gave dragon pets a leash range  
unlike the other big summons mordekaisers dragon didnt have a leash range and wasnt intended to have one mordekaiser could be bot lane while his dragon was mid except that for the first year of juggernaut mordekaisers existence  all the way up until we found the explanation  his dragon had no leash range with the basic skin and had one if he wore any other skin the dragon would blink back to him if hed go further than 2000 units away from him videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvw2zsy072gz4lt

ampnbsp

2 what happened when mordekaiser killed ekko after ulting him 

 a ekkos ghost ulted the blue teams fountain before warping back to where he died 

 b ekkos ghost had permanently increased range and each of his attacks made him dash to his target 

 c ekkos ghost spawned on the blue teams fountain and instantly died if mordekaiser was on the red team 

 d ekkos ultimate was replaced with mordekaisers for the remainder of the game 

correct answer gta ekkos ghost ulted the blue teams fountain before warping back to where he died  
dealing full damage and all counted as mordekaisers videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9ucnmbm65w4lt

ampnbsp

3 what happened when sylas attempted to use mordekaisers ultimate on a target entering a bush

 a the target immediately died and respawned without a death timer 

 b mordekaiser gained control of the resulting ghost instead of sylas 

 c sylas transformed into mordekaiser until his death 

 d sylas lost the ability to use his keystone until the end of the game 

correct answer gtc sylas transformed into mordekaiser until his death  
when ulting sylas takes the shape of the champion he uses the ult of during the cast but with mordekaisers ult if the spell got canceled by losing vision on the target he would just not transform back until his death thread with a video and everythinghttpswwwredditcomrmordekaisermainscommentsambxjiexplaining_the_sylas_transforming_intolt

ampnbsp

4 runes affecting shields have a history of not working correctly for mordekaiser by how much did revitalize increase his shield generation at most

 a 0

 b 165

 c 110

 d 1005

correct answer gtd 1005  
for years revitalize didnt work properly on mordekaisers shield generation gain 5 hsp heals and shields you cast or receive are 10 stronger on targets below 40 hp then someday it got fixed except that instead of increasing his shield by 5 and 10 it went on to increase it by 5  1000 heres what his passivehttpsprntsclkmaz0 and ehttpsprntsclkmgno looked like with itlt

ampnbsp

5 what happened when pulsefire ezreal killed an enemy affected by mordekaisers ultimate

 a no ghost was created 

 b a ghost was created but its basic attacks were permanently replaced with targeted mystic shots 

 c a ghost was created but it was permanently invisible and impossible to click on 

 d a ghost was created but it was permanently invisible and stuck in place 

correct answer gtc a ghost was created but it was permanently invisible and impossible to click on  
in most cases mordekaisers ghosts took the shape and most properties that the champion had upon dying a champion turning into a ghost while in an invisible state would in several cases make the ghost fully invisible and pulsefire ezreal disintegrates the enemies he kills videohttpsyoutubezfm4ot4cftgt590lt

ampnbsp

6 what could mordekaiser not do for his opponents 

 a give an enemy a heal of 1500 hitpoints with his w 

 b give the opposing team the baron buff 

 c give the enemies his location through fog of war 

 d give the other team bonus ap with his ultimate 

correct answer gtd give the other team bonus ap with his ultimate  
a an enemy braum could eat mordekaisers heal and take it for himself and that heal could go in the 1500range videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdcpoy2c3hsw  
b no video of that one but if youd attack baron with the ghost of a darius have the ghost die and then have baron die from the bleed itd be given to darius team and not to yours  
c mordekaisers w detonation could be heard through fog of war if youd put your camera over where an enemy mordekaiser was and hed use his w youd be able to hear it even without vision videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvptbk6fguzyelt

ampnbsp

7 a jhin ghost could have some advantages compared to the real jhin which one of these options could a jhin ghost not have

 a every attack firing the 4th shot 

 b 25 attack speed 

 c attack range permanently increased to 700 

 d critical hits dealing 200225 damage at all levels 

correct answer gtd critical hits dealing 200225 damage at all levels  
a probably mordekaisers most famous interaction  jhins ghost would never use ammunition and as such would remain on whatever bullet he died with so killing a jhin with his fourth shot ready would result in the ghost firing his fourth shot on every basic attack videohttpsyoutubex4oi_orobpit25  
b jhins ghost also had unlocked attack speed so he could reach upwards of 25 as videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlr4yzo0npi0  
c ghosts could gain energized charges but they couldnt trigger statikkrfcs empowered attacks that meant that they would never lose the charges and that rfcs increased range would apply to every attack once charged  
d that one is almost applicable too jhins crits deal reduced damage compared to other champions but for some reason a jhin ghost would only get that damage reduction after level 16  crits before that dealt full damage d ends up being the correct answer because of at all levels  
and heres a display of a fearsome jhin ghosthttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv_9f4lg9s6walt  

ampnbsp

8 what could happen when you activated the guardian angel of an opponent affected by mordekaisers ultimate

 a your ultimate was replaced with mordekaisers for the remainder of the game 

 b your abilities stopped functioning until the ghost died 

 c every player crashed and the game disappeared 

 d the opponents guardian angel was automatically sold the moment it was activated 

correct answer gta your ultimate was replaced with mordekaisers for the remainder of the game  
theres an explanation but just take the videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtatl2xjvmbqlt

ampnbsp

9 what could using protobelt cause for mordekaiser

 a make mordekaisers ghosts release the protobelt projectiles on every basic attack for the rest of the game 

 b make mordekaisers w invisible for the rest of the game 

 c prevent mordekaisers e from dealing damage 

 d disable the opponents press the attack keystone 

correct answer gtb make mordekaisers w invisible for the rest of the game  
using protobelt with w active would make the effects of the spell disappear from that point on for all players who had their screen on mordekaiser the moment he used the item on either team videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmfhwirwqvxklt

10 what happened when mordekaiser used his ultimate to kill an enemy mordekaisers ghost

 a the champion killed gained the ability to create a dragon ghost 

 b the ghost refreshed and came back with full health and a full timer under the control of the enemy mordekaiser but lost its items 

 c mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed and until his next death his shield would fully refill whenever it got depleted 

 d mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed but with a permanent 100 attack speed and bonus movement speed 

correct answer gtd mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed but with a permanent 100 attack speed and bonus movement speed  
this was a bug that i found really late despite playing a lot of blind pick i guess you just never think of wasting your ult on a ghost i have no idea how that happened but the ghost of a ghost had some properties of a dragon ghost  mordekaisers ult icon was replaced with the one he got from controlling the dragon the ghost gained bonus movespeed towards morde like the dragons it had bonus attack speed and it didnt gain the bonus ad and hp that a champion ghost would get from mordekaisers stats this couldnt be chained  that ghost would not give a ghost from being ulted by mordekaiser videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlr4yzo0npi0lt

what score did yall get ive made this quiz a year or two ago but only privately shared it and im very curious to see what everyone would guess

"lets be honest the old banner of command was toxic i too remember that meta where you got baron and put an ivern bush on the minion while it four shot towers that said i think from an enjoyment standpoint that was a better place for the usage of a splitpushing item that also had usage  when playing with the team we know that that iteration of the split push item has since went the way of the dodo due to balancing issues which was of course reasonable what is interesting to note here is that i feel hullbreaker serves the role of a splitpusher item even worse at the end of the end hullbreaker is the single largest stat stick riot has ever made to the point where it becoming a staple item on champions that want to teamfight eg yas yone and even 4th on samira this not only is the least interactive way to make a champion strong is the sidelane its not even at the expense of teamfighting power since the core stats are so insane anyways at the end of the day hullbreaker as has managed to do a poorer job at being a splitpushers item then its previous iterations and i think that thats a damn shame i think at this point the item archetype is here to stay so what do you think could be done to make a splitpushing item that feels less oppressive and more skill expressive

  
note though i do fully agree with the above post it is the sole result of losing a game to a tryndamere ",Bad Teammates
"ive always been a bit of a tryhard in league because it was the only game i could play on my shitty laptop at the time and i thought thats just how youre supposed to play to a large extent im still that despite being ok with someone playing off meta picks i still kind of just mentally accepted the loss and moved on i never really understood the appeal i guess 

then i built my current pc which can run basically any game i can think of and i got into elden ring a large part of elden ring content online if youre not into pvp and im def not into elden ring pvp lol is challenge runs with weird builds some of my favourite youtubers are lilaggy and bushy if you want an example of what im talking about when i saw their content i really enjoyed it despite me not liking offmeta stuff in league and i think its because elden ring is pve 

imo the biggest problem with playing offmeta in league is that its a team game and theres always someone who wont be ok with you playing suboptimally because they want to win in the more standard way instead of whatever whacky shenanigans your pick gets up to if youre playing something like idk shack support and your adc has never played with a shaco before the lane is gonna be unnecessarily hard right 

this is why i think league needs a good pve mode like odyssey in 2018 its explicitly for fun and maybe you can even grind it for rewards but the important thing is that its playing against an ai so if you decide to go ap graves or something its no big deal 

urf kinda used to be like this before everyone figured out that adcs were the best role even in urf wow shocker adc is op who could have seen this coming but even that was playing against other people i think we can all agree that being the weird off meta pick in urf and being ahead and cheesing everyone is very fun but being the victim of the offmeta pick and being cheesed makes you want to break your monitor 

what do you guys think would you want an odyssey style pve mode i feel like it would be really good for the game",Bad Teammates
"i want to know if someone else consistently experiences this

ampx200b

i will have games where my attacks carve through anything and everything and i will have games were it takes 6 auto attacks to kill a minion this happens in downrank games where league forces a loss on you in order to keep you at a 50 winrate in uprank games at the same game time items and level i will 2 hit the same minion the same applies to champions my most recent experience was a cait vs tristana game where i would hit her with 6 auto attacks and she left with 95 hp while she hit me 2 times and i walked away with lt25 hp this was early game so there was no meaningful difference in abilities or items no traps or nets were used in this engagement only auto attacks

everyone keeps calling it a skill issue because its a toxic community but when dumping 1400 damage into an adc with miss fortunes ultimate hitting the whole thing and the adc walking away with most of its hp it is hardly a skill issue anymore in games with identical item sets levels and game times that kind of attack would completely kill the same adc i also want to stress that the times this has happened the adc in question always has less hp at the time than the total damage dealt by the ultimate

ampx200b

the same thing also happens when playing master yi where randomly my attacks will do 5x as much damage as normal and some games they do practically nothing i have looked into every single stat i can think of from armor magic resist life steal weird items runes dragon buffs etc no matter how much i look i see no meaningful difference in characters builds or all of the above that would explain these experiences i hope that some of you have gone through something similar so i can finally figure this out

ampx200b

finally i wish to note this applies to everyone in my lobby we are a 3 stack and we all consistently experience this difference in damage output and enemy damage negation always at the same time in the same matches i assume many more out there have this issue and it is being attributed to a skill issue despite no change in playstyle nor build on either team

edit  
dont bother commenting if you have not experienced it if you have nothing to add you are just taking up space the reason for this is that this thread is not about people screaming at eachother but rather to see if it is a widespread issue if toxic people spam toxic comments it will drown out the meaningful content i addressed the usual responses above so no comments repeating the same thing are needed as the point have been made alredy

edit edit  
this is not about getting a rank its about consistent gameplay even in blind pick

edit edit edit  
i want to stress as its been mentioned in the comments i am not talking about  losers queue i have not heard the term used before but from what i read it is about pairing you with bad teammates i am talking about actual debuffs like doing less damage luxs q having a smaller hitbox in some games compared to others and players generally taking less damage from attacks this is not a post about bad teammates but a post about game mechanics",Bad Teammates

xerath is not a support it should be only picked at mid lane it has good range and damage but in late game the champ becomes a feeding machine it doesnt have anything to protect the carry from their bruisers fighters support role should be used for supporting the team with utilities such as good cc healing shielding granting movement speed an ap mid laner is already doing what the xerath can do doing so much damage or winning the bot lane early will be useless so many times when the game hits 25 minutes in if they have a supporting champion like can front line and provide sustain or cc such as thresh leona rell lulu nautilus etc also so many trash xerath players ruin the game for adcs by stealing farm thinking they can carry alone lmao if a xerath support cant win the game under 20 minutes that game is usually a lose,Bad Teammates

"hi all

a little background on my situation im a multiaccount master tier adc main looking to give something back to the community that i grew up with through solo queue coaching ive tutored both in college and high school but outside of that i have no coaching experience in league or anywhere else i sometimes review vods of my friendsmutuals to help others improve and overall i have a very strong sense of macro knowledge in my particular role i found that there are very few adc educational content creators coaches and resources compared to other roles so i figure the market is open to adc coaches at the moment

i am looking at the first page of google for coaching services and applying to each one i am qualified for however i am a bit stuck on what exactly i should be doing to get prepared so far ive
watched countless challenger adc coaching videos on yt
began setting up a coachify profile

chat and ranked restrictions yes they come in pairs only target people who typed something that the system deems offensive soft inting and inting in general is not target or resolved by this new system all this system does is punish human interaction in game eg i got a chat and ranked restriction for typing the enemy comp is cancer  


and in my opinion the punishment should be proportional to the crime if someone is being a meanie in chat forcing them to play game modes they dont like and taking away their ability to communicate will only make matters worse for  everyone people who play video games or go outside will know that banter is a normal part of human interaction calling something i did retarded or somebody else a dick  for smiting a cannon is totally normal

"just something to read before worlds 2023 swiss stage starts sourcehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfen_ihkqdpa 

nofe was a former league coach and is currently an lck caster this is a quick review of the 2023 worlds playins meta alongside a prediction of how the meta will shift during the swiss stage

ampx200b

translation

as always im going to focus on drafts and meta instead of hyperfocusing on individual teams so my goal is to guess the swiss stage meta by taking a look at what worked well in playins  

if you look at how metas shifted during various stages of previous worlds there is a very obvious trend  obviously playin teams have a much lower level of play  and this is reflected in their drafts these teams tend to draft with a focus on teamfights in the later stages of the tournament the stronger teams are much more lane focused and this isnt just a matter of preference in the playin stage teamfightfocused comps tend to have a much higher winrate  

this pattern held in this years playins despite all the speculation about how the worlds patch would play out¬†the playin stage meta was all about teamfighting that being said the meta will probably change drastically once the swiss stage begins just like how previous metas shifted drastically during the group stage the best asian teams are very good at snowballing off of lane advantages which is the reason why lower tier teams have such a hard time pulling off upsets anyways the swiss stage meta will probably be completely different from the playin stage meta and my predictions are attempting to account for that 

ampx200b

top 

 keeping that in mind lets take a look at which champions had priority during playins starting with top there were 2 picks that stood out  ksante and renekton renektons mr nerfs compounded with the statikk shiv nerfs made it look like split pushers like gp gnar and gwen would dominate the meta but these champions didnt manage to make it onto the stage defying expectations ksante and renekton held strong when teams were forced to blind pick top most teams chose to pick renekton these teamfight powerhouses were popular especially among weaker teams interestingly ksante fared very well in the head to head against renekton renektons greatest strengths are his lane priority into his strong herald fights but ksante neutralized these advantages very well rumble and kennen were also strong picks into renekton especially when paired with jayce mid i believe this ap top  jayce mid pattern will carry on into the swiss stage if you look at the results ksante did much better than renekton renekton was much weaker than previous patches especially against ap tops oh and adams gods were definitely interesting to watch im not sure how well these picks will work out in the swiss stage against the strong asian top laners they all play mean gnars and theres also a slight chance that some asian tops will counter with fiora reminiscent of former worlds since this is a meta where junglers actually go top it will be interesting to see how the asian teams interpret gods 

so what do i expect to see during the swiss stage to begin with i predict a lot of kennens and gnars and maybe gangplank depending on the player i dont want to get too deep into this since itll take a long time to explain but the top pool depends on the mid pool with the popularity of syndra and orianna standing mages that have a hard time side laning top lane champions with strong side laning abilites will naturally become much better champions like jax these champions and their lane counters will become much more prominent in the swiss stage

ampx200b

jg 

 moving on to jungle if you look at solo queue statistics lee sin nidalee and jarvan look very powerful but so far this trend didnt make its way into pro play maokai dominated of course theres a chance that this is due to the fact that playin teams prefer teamfighting champs taliyah was also a high priority pick i thought about the jg picks for a very long time and ive arrived at a conclusion which jungles will be meta im sorry to say this but i expect maokai and sejuani to be the most contested jungles syndra orianna and azir are going to me the mid meta champs  no question about that these champions need a strong dependable frontline will top play this role no jax and gnar are going to be splitpushing which leads to the natural conclusion  were going to see tank jungles like sejuani and maokai i expect lots of maokai sejuani jarvan and vi maybe nocturne to aid the splitpushing top or even some viegos in other words the champs weve seen all summer with the addition of jarvan with lee sin im not sure despite currently performing well in solo queue and scrims lee generally tends to do poorly on stage some lck teams like t1 and dk who love snowballing might take the risk and lpl teams like blg might try as well lee sin works well with sylas galio and lissandra which are all champions that yagao excels at 

 oh and slightly unrelated but there has to be an lck or lpl team that plays taliyah all the time in scrims the playin teams drafted heavily around taliyah especially bds teams seem to place rate taliyah very highly which personally didnt make much sense looking in from the outside taliyah does have swap value though so some lck and lpl teams might bust her out on stage  

ampx200b

mid 

 next on to mid despite all of the nerfs azir is still a strong meta pick with a strong skill set good late game value and playmaking ability azir simply refuses to leave the pro meta the skill set is one that pro players refuse to give up azir is just too good at parrying kill threats from champs like rakan and jarvan and azirs late game value is strong too melting tanks and poking the champion is too perfect yone and akali match well into azir though so expect to see a few of those the asian mids are all great at yone and akali their mere existence prevents blind pick azir which i expect to limit azirs impact on the meta post swiss stage  

 this patch orianna and syndra are insane¬†if you look at the data both champs have high presence and syndras win rate is off the charts since stronger teams tend to put higher priority on laning these champions will become even more important as time progresses expect to see more of these two not less i expect that all of you know about showmakers syndra or fakers infamous orianna shockwave no matter who you look at be it bdd knight yagao etc all of the koreanchinese mid laners are extremely proficient at playing orianna and syndra not a single player is bad on these champs  maybe xiaohu but even xiaohu was once famous for his mid mages there are no weak players neeko is also a strong playmaking pick alongside adcs like kaisa and i expect to see some neekos but her laning is not quite as strong as it once was it really depends on the team and the players sylasakaliyone will be utilized by teams focused on midgame especially teams that prefer strong mid carries like gen g and dk there is a good chance that we see these champs sylas may have a hard time laning against ap mid mages but he does have an advantage against team comps with powerful ults maokai sejuani gnar and gp all have strong ults furthering the case for sylas last but not least leblanc could see some minor play paired with lee sin all in all the mid meta is interesting because there are so many champions that could see fringe play even galio and lissandra could see some play tristana and annie are not as strong anymore i would prefer jayce over tristana

ampx200b

bot 

when you build a team comp the choice of adc is the most important thing to consider the entire team composition is warped around the choice of adc in that sense there are 2 champions that have very distinct flavors  xayah and kaisa if your team has xayah the goal is to make the other team come into you you want 2 things  a sturdy front line and¬†long range¬†xayah comps go hand in hand with mid mages and with long range mids azir jayce tristana force the enemy to engage and let xayah clean up 

kaisa is the polar opposite of xayah the entire teamfight revolves around how well you can focus fire a single priority target when kaisa ults in kaisa loves champions like yone ahri and neeko not that kaisa cant be used with say orianna but if you want to make the most use out of kaisas dps you need to draft a dive comp 

 ezreal aphelios and zeri made their mark during playins looking at solo queue data the best adcs were champs like ezreal ashe kalista and jhin all supportive adcs without a single hypercarry the adc carry meta was nonexistant but in playins the meta did a 180 and shifted towards hypercarry adcs but its impossible to tell how the meta will shift during the swiss stage lck and lpl teams can take a bot lane advantage and snowball the entire game off of that so we could see a lot of ezreal karma kalista   caitlyn   etc if teams can manage to annihilate kaisas and xayahs during the laning phase the adc tier list can change drastically so its really hard to predict what will be strong until we actualy see what happens on stage and since adcs are the backbone of team comps drafts will be completely different depending on what ends up on top 

 if it turns out that supportive adcs like ashe and jhin are dominant then teams will start playing around mid game comps in this case theyre going to have to find late game value somewhere else  which will probably result in a surge in popularity of powerful splitpushing top laners so the top meta depends on the adc tier list itll be fun to see what ends up on top no one knows whats going to be good but if theres one thing im certain of its that utility supports are really really weak compared to previous seasons so well be seeing lots nautilus rakan and rell this points towards kalista being strong and ezrealcaitlyn being weak but its hard to tell sivir isnt bad and teams with skilled support players might play senna since senna funnels gold into supports but i think that kalista will be the staple meta adc if initiation supports are meta then kalista will be used to both compliment them and to have a strong laning phase kalista is good at transfering bot lane dominace into the upper half of the map and she pairs off with mid mages very well and people have this perception that kalista is complete crap late game but shes stronger than youd think even though she doesnt compare to actual hypercarry adcs 

i could be totally wrong and the meta could shift to something i couldnt have dreamed of in a million years just take this as my personal take the meta will change from swiss to knock out to finals so its really impossible to tell at this point to summarize my personal opinion  

ampx200b

summary 

predictions before playins supportive adcs like ashe and jhin will be meta top amp jg will play carry picks mid mages will be strong 

ampx200b

the playin meta adc hypercarry meta and junglers mostly played tanks mid mages were strong  

ampx200b

swiss stage predictions we will have a top amp jungle carry meta with a few¬†adc hypercarry comps sprinkled in depending on the team teams will try to snowball through bot and roll the snowball up to top and in the process the high priority champions will be strong side laners like gnar gwen jax and bot snowball champs like kalista some adcs might play hypercarry adcs like xayah and kaisa azir syndra and orianna will be strong picks in the midlane

 jungle tank junglers are up while ap junglers are doing fine and most ad junglers are bad now riot should bring 68 bad scaling back for the jungle pet briar op and j4 are the 2 best ad junglers and j4 sits around 51
 items duskblade is pretty much dead youmuus is now back in action riot just swaps these 2 around all the time no clue why they cant balance both
 runes a few untouched or slightly touched runes like fleet or phase rush are very strong right now electrocute is likely niche comapred to first strike and dark harvest comet loses power vs aery and aery becomes very strong

chat and ranked restrictions yes they come in pairs only target people who typed something that the system deems offensive soft inting and inting in general is not target or resolved by this new system all this system does is punish human interaction in game eg i got a chat and ranked restriction for typing the enemy comp is cancer  


and in my opinion the punishment should be proportional to the crime if someone is being a meanie in chat forcing them to play game modes they dont like and taking away their ability to communicate will only make matters worse for  everyone people who play video games or go outside will know that banter is a normal part of human interaction calling something i did retarded or somebody else a dick  for smiting a cannon is totally normal

i joined the raffle every day since the start of playins so those are 7 entries some days only a couple thousand people joined the raffle so i figured my chances of winning one were pretty high unfortunately i did not win anything

as the title says i am curious if anyone actually won a mercedes hextech chest in the daily raffle and if anyone won one what did you get out of the chest i wonder if they are any different compared to normal hextech or masterwork chests they look pretty neat at least

"just something to read before worlds 2023 swiss stage starts sourcehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfen_ihkqdpa 

nofe was a former league coach and is currently an lck caster this is a quick review of the 2023 worlds playins meta alongside a prediction of how the meta will shift during the swiss stage

ampx200b

translation

as always im going to focus on drafts and meta instead of hyperfocusing on individual teams so my goal is to guess the swiss stage meta by taking a look at what worked well in playins  

if you look at how metas shifted during various stages of previous worlds there is a very obvious trend  obviously playin teams have a much lower level of play  and this is reflected in their drafts these teams tend to draft with a focus on teamfights in the later stages of the tournament the stronger teams are much more lane focused and this isnt just a matter of preference in the playin stage teamfightfocused comps tend to have a much higher winrate  

this pattern held in this years playins despite all the speculation about how the worlds patch would play out¬†the playin stage meta was all about teamfighting that being said the meta will probably change drastically once the swiss stage begins just like how previous metas shifted drastically during the group stage the best asian teams are very good at snowballing off of lane advantages which is the reason why lower tier teams have such a hard time pulling off upsets anyways the swiss stage meta will probably be completely different from the playin stage meta and my predictions are attempting to account for that 

ampx200b

top 

 keeping that in mind lets take a look at which champions had priority during playins starting with top there were 2 picks that stood out  ksante and renekton renektons mr nerfs compounded with the statikk shiv nerfs made it look like split pushers like gp gnar and gwen would dominate the meta but these champions didnt manage to make it onto the stage defying expectations ksante and renekton held strong when teams were forced to blind pick top most teams chose to pick renekton these teamfight powerhouses were popular especially among weaker teams interestingly ksante fared very well in the head to head against renekton renektons greatest strengths are his lane priority into his strong herald fights but ksante neutralized these advantages very well rumble and kennen were also strong picks into renekton especially when paired with jayce mid i believe this ap top  jayce mid pattern will carry on into the swiss stage if you look at the results ksante did much better than renekton renekton was much weaker than previous patches especially against ap tops oh and adams gods were definitely interesting to watch im not sure how well these picks will work out in the swiss stage against the strong asian top laners they all play mean gnars and theres also a slight chance that some asian tops will counter with fiora reminiscent of former worlds since this is a meta where junglers actually go top it will be interesting to see how the asian teams interpret gods 

so what do i expect to see during the swiss stage to begin with i predict a lot of kennens and gnars and maybe gangplank depending on the player i dont want to get too deep into this since itll take a long time to explain but the top pool depends on the mid pool with the popularity of syndra and orianna standing mages that have a hard time side laning top lane champions with strong side laning abilites will naturally become much better champions like jax these champions and their lane counters will become much more prominent in the swiss stage

 moving on to jungle if you look at solo queue statistics lee sin nidalee and jarvan look very powerful but so far this trend didnt make its way into pro play maokai dominated of course theres a chance that this is due to the fact that playin teams prefer teamfighting champs taliyah was also a high priority pick i thought about the jg picks for a very long time and ive arrived at a conclusion which jungles will be meta im sorry to say this but i expect maokai and sejuani to be the most contested jungles syndra orianna and azir are going to me the mid meta champs  no question about that these champions need a strong dependable frontline will top play this role no jax and gnar are going to be splitpushing which leads to the natural conclusion  were going to see tank jungles like sejuani and maokai i expect lots of maokai sejuani jarvan and vi maybe nocturne to aid the splitpushing top or even some viegos in other words the champs weve seen all summer with the addition of jarvan with lee sin im not sure despite currently performing well in solo queue and scrims lee generally tends to do poorly on stage some lck teams like t1 and dk who love snowballing might take the risk and lpl teams like blg might try as well lee sin works well with sylas galio and lissandra which are all champions that yagao excels at 

 oh and slightly unrelated but there has to be an lck or lpl team that plays taliyah all the time in scrims the playin teams drafted heavily around taliyah especially bds teams seem to place rate taliyah very highly which personally didnt make much sense looking in from the outside taliyah does have swap value though so some lck and lpl teams might bust her out on stage

mid 

 next on to mid despite all of the nerfs azir is still a strong meta pick with a strong skill set good late game value and playmaking ability azir simply refuses to leave the pro meta the skill set is one that pro players refuse to give up azir is just too good at parrying kill threats from champs like rakan and jarvan and azirs late game value is strong too melting tanks and poking the champion is too perfect yone and akali match well into azir though so expect to see a few of those the asian mids are all great at yone and akali their mere existence prevents blind pick azir which i expect to limit azirs impact on the meta post swiss stage  

 this patch orianna and syndra are insane¬†if you look at the data both champs have high presence and syndras win rate is off the charts since stronger teams tend to put higher priority on laning these champions will become even more important as time progresses expect to see more of these two not less i expect that all of you know about showmakers syndra or fakers infamous orianna shockwave no matter who you look at be it bdd knight yagao etc all of the koreanchinese mid laners are extremely proficient at playing orianna and syndra not a single player is bad on these champs  maybe xiaohu but even xiaohu was once famous for his mid mages there are no weak players neeko is also a strong playmaking pick alongside adcs like kaisa and i expect to see some neekos but her laning is not quite as strong as it once was it really depends on the team and the players sylasakaliyone will be utilized by teams focused on midgame especially teams that prefer strong mid carries like gen g and dk there is a good chance that we see these champs sylas may have a hard time laning against ap mid mages but he does have an advantage against team comps with powerful ults maokai sejuani gnar and gp all have strong ults furthering the case for sylas last but not least leblanc could see some minor play paired with lee sin all in all the mid meta is interesting because there are so many champions that could see fringe play even galio and lissandra could see some play tristana and annie are not as strong anymore i would prefer jayce over tristana

bot 

when you build a team comp the choice of adc is the most important thing to consider the entire team composition is warped around the choice of adc in that sense there are 2 champions that have very distinct flavors  xayah and kaisa if your team has xayah the goal is to make the other team come into you you want 2 things  a sturdy front line and¬†long range¬†xayah comps go hand in hand with mid mages and with long range mids azir jayce tristana force the enemy to engage and let xayah clean up 

kaisa is the polar opposite of xayah the entire teamfight revolves around how well you can focus fire a single priority target when kaisa ults in kaisa loves champions like yone ahri and neeko not that kaisa cant be used with say orianna but if you want to make the most use out of kaisas dps you need to draft a dive comp 

 ezreal aphelios and zeri made their mark during playins looking at solo queue data the best adcs were champs like ezreal ashe kalista and jhin all supportive adcs without a single hypercarry the adc carry meta was nonexistant but in playins the meta did a 180 and shifted towards hypercarry adcs but its impossible to tell how the meta will shift during the swiss stage lck and lpl teams can take a bot lane advantage and snowball the entire game off of that so we could see a lot of ezreal karma kalista   caitlyn   etc if teams can manage to annihilate kaisas and xayahs during the laning phase the adc tier list can change drastically so its really hard to predict what will be strong until we actualy see what happens on stage and since adcs are the backbone of team comps drafts will be completely different depending on what ends up on top 

 if it turns out that supportive adcs like ashe and jhin are dominant then teams will start playing around mid game comps in this case theyre going to have to find late game value somewhere else  which will probably result in a surge in popularity of powerful splitpushing top laners so the top meta depends on the adc tier list itll be fun to see what ends up on top no one knows whats going to be good but if theres one thing im certain of its that utility supports are really really weak compared to previous seasons so well be seeing lots nautilus rakan and rell this points towards kalista being strong and ezrealcaitlyn being weak but its hard to tell sivir isnt bad and teams with skilled support players might play senna since senna funnels gold into supports but i think that kalista will be the staple meta adc if initiation supports are meta then kalista will be used to both compliment them and to have a strong laning phase kalista is good at transfering bot lane dominace into the upper half of the map and she pairs off with mid mages very well and people have this perception that kalista is complete crap late game but shes stronger than youd think even though she doesnt compare to actual hypercarry adcs 

i could be totally wrong and the meta could shift to something i couldnt have dreamed of in a million years just take this as my personal take the meta will change from swiss to knock out to finals so its really impossible to tell at this point to summarize my personal opinion  

ampx200b

summary 

predictions before playins supportive adcs like ashe and jhin will be meta top amp jg will play carry picks mid mages will be strong 

ampx200b

the playin meta adc hypercarry meta and junglers mostly played tanks mid mages were strong  

ampx200b

swiss stage predictions we will have a top amp jungle carry meta with a few¬†adc hypercarry comps sprinkled in depending on the team teams will try to snowball through bot and roll the snowball up to top and in the process the high priority champions will be strong side laners like gnar gwen jax and bot snowball champs like kalista some adcs might play hypercarry adcs like xayah and kaisa azir syndra and orianna will be strong picks in the midlane

"kayn

  kayn already has an indicator for his e but it shows only either his full duration length or the reduced length while there is already an audio cue thats played when his e runs out due to not being in a wall i think a visual clarification via an indicator could also help

ampx200b

 i think similarly an outofchampioncombatindicator could help so that you arent suprised when you directly exit the wall  maybe for this and the previous point there could also be an elegant solution which i dont see

ampx200b

 on the vision of e i feel lt is unintuitive for enemies that he just has a vision radius around him when inside a wall and can thus see over other walls he isnt inside off i dont think you can see his shadowball inside the wall through fow so the enemies dont know that he sees them either walls could proberly block vision or the enemies could be notified wth eyes over their head

ampx200b

  expanding on the point of vision in e it can be confusing for kayn himself to understand that he doesnt get vision in bushes during e same for zoe ult  normaly bushes you dont have vision of throw a shadow onto themselfes however since for kaynzoe during er bushes dont throw a shadow it looks as if you have vision inside even though you dont  i understand that at least for kayn if bushes would throw shadows his vision inside some walls would get severely nerfed  but one could also try to implement that the bushes dont apear as bright

"for those who dont know alois is a challenger top lane player he peaked rank 8 in euw split 1

ampx200b

this is one of the best top laners in the world losing in emerald elo not once but 23 games he played does this mean alois is a garbage player of course not alois is one of the best top lane players in euw so what does it mean then

ampx200b

it means emerald is extremely unbalanced imagine you are a diamond 4 player in terms of skill and youre placed into these games a challenger no the rank 8 player is still losing in these games so how exactly is a low diamond player supposed to climb well looking at this theres a very easy answer he isnt he cant 

ampx200b

now dont get me wrong here alois is one of the best top laners in euw he will climb out of emerald and with ease it is possible if you are 1k lp above emerald sure but for low diamond players just wanting to reach the rank they belong in no chance none if the best top lane players in the world are losing in this elo there is no chance a diamond player will be able to consistently carry the games necessary to be able to climb out

"hello besties as you may know riot is buffing seraphine support as part of these changes they are reducing her scaling and giving her more early power  which is like you know kinda against her hyperscaling fantasy buuuuut i can accept it a bit so long as we remain a scaling champ but phreak has clearly outlined that they are fine if seraphine mid stops existing as collateral damage since she has a super low lt050 pr in most elos so basically nonexistant already

hohohoewever i think this is a good moment to address the elephant in the room swain

over the years swain support his most loyal fanbase has gotten nothing but changes that helped midlane and top because of incessant whining from mid and top the roles that basically had no playrate right now his pr is at a whooping 1 after what 2 3 jhins funny number of mini reworks

and thats where the changes landed

well no sir i say no sir

we in the support role lost our super cool pull whenever enemy is cc for these mid fans clamoring for mages to hardly even play him anyway and forcing swain into a perpetual 50 wr of oh he is viable not super good tho just because they whined and now dont even want to use him and after all this they still complain about oh i would totally use him you dont get it i actually love swain and wish him to be viable except he is right there he is literally standing there drinking a margarita in midlane waiting for you to come inside his loving embrace and you are just there dumbfounded saying nu uh

wtf 

meanwhile supps playerbase has only grown over the years rising to a near 5pr because we support chads love our draco malphoys dad whose name i cant remember looking ahh crow daddy who probably gives good hugs i say if they dont want him give it to support players again reintroduce cc pull on ally and give him mk scorpions get over here anytime he uses it

anyway thats just my what i think i am looking forward to seraphines changes the q speed buff specially will be so awesome lets go seraqueens

oh yeah it happens a lot you have teammates who go play like 50 games a day then theyre just burned out they feel like i am inting but they dont say it because they are chat restricted right so they bait ping me instead

they dont feel like i am doing anything right and i dont feel like they want to play with me or something so i just roam and make plays happenand it turns into a vicious cycle

"if i recall correctly seraphine on release was advertised as a midsupport champion bot lane carry seraphine did not exist until she was nerfed out of mid lane and made more reliant on allies seraphine was not designed as an ap carry bot laner she coincidentally became good at the role after changes to her kit is she good at it yes but it is not her intended role is she a good apc yes was she designed as a scaling carry mage also yes but was she designed to farm safely protected by a support and scale for free in the duo lane until she hard carries teamfights no im not saying that playstyle shouldnt exist though it is incredibly obnoxious to me personally who likes facing double enchanter but you should be happy that riot is still allowing it to even exist when it was all in all a happy accident they didnt do that with pantheon support or solo lane pyke

ampx200b

as for her not being a support i dont understand why i see this sentiment thrown around all the time she has an 80 pick rate as support and i see people arguing with this as its just randoms who are picking her support her devoted playerbase is playing her apc ok but still 80 of her playerbase literally recognizes her as being a decent support and she even has 50 winrate to back it up why am i seeing she is literally so bad as support its disgusting being thrown around under every thread no shes not her gameplay is still very much supportive even champion insights seraphine mentions this  with her supportive gameplay locked all that was left was to give this pop star some tunes morgana literally has a root and black shield and yall have been crying for morgana buffs but seraphine with aoe charm aoe shieldhealms aoe slowrootstun is not a support okay

ampx200b

i just dont like the amount of backhanded comments coming from a minority thinking it should be catered to its insane if youre afraid her win rate will drop in masters you should be able to learn another champion if youre masters youll be fine i know it sucks your champ is nerfed but like who cares about seraphine support is really cope if anything people care even less about your toxic double enchanter lane

i graciously rise from my 29arammarathoninduced slumber at the highly productive hour of 2 am with immense enthusiasm i shout to the heavens another day another triumph in the prestigious aram mode of league of legends

as i click the league of legends icon im greeted by an enigmatic app called riot client  it dares to demand my username and password curiosity piqued i decide to create a fresh account of the day behold leesinsblind is born and it tells me ive successfully signed up in oce a realm i have absolutely no clue about riot games the masterminds behind league of legends mustve recognized my true potential and granted me this unheardof rank

i dive into a brisk warmup aram and what do you know lee sin graces me with his presence to clarify for the less enlightened among you lee sin is a jackofalltrades masterofeverything champion his hidden passive rendering me blind as a bat and not due to any moonshine incident mind you

his q ability is an autotargeted missile that homes in on the nearest adc whether in this game or the next revealing their location and providing me with vital information like their credit score and their mothers relationship status if im not satisfied with their financial health a quick qpress sends them packing wiping their league account and transferring their gold to my offshore bank account

my w ability involves dashing to an ally and shielding them but lets be real shields are overrated when youve already started the game with four death dances and can heal from true damage no big deal

my e well it marks the area around lee sin essentially functioning as an aoe nuke unfortunately it only obliterates nearby champions and provides a meager 300 ingame currency such a pittance i know

and now lee sins pi√®ce de r√©sistance his ultimate r trying to explain it to mere mortals is a task reserved for the elite minds of at least bronze 4 ill demonstrate its incredible power in due course

as the game begins the enemy team quakes in terror at the mere sight of me lee sin who shows no mercy i order them to line up in front of their nexus as their towers and inhibitors have wisely sworn allegiance to my cause their feeble cries fall on deaf ears as i meticulously pass judgment with my q one by one

the enemy team attempts to surrender realizing their futility against my unparalleled might but i the benevolent lee sin reject their pleas as i eagerly await the airdrop of my new item

at last i decide its time to claim my rightful victory i casually stroll up to the enemy rammus whos rocking a cool 971 armor and press my ultimate at him together we watch in awe as he rockets towards his own nexus shattering their base and presumably his monitor along with it

"intro  
hey guys  my company has been working on a fantasy app which is a little unique to traditional fantasy sports  it is 100 free to play there is no option to even take your money and is currently being tested and used for fun  i just today set it up to work with worlds and created a few public rooms that i hope people are interested in participating in  if the public rooms fill up  i will create more or you can create your own private rooms and invite your friends  


how to play  
simply navigate to auctionmadnesscomhttpsauctionmadnesscom and sign up with your gmail or email account  once in you will see that you can choose to create a group for you and your friends or join a public room and play with others  for worlds group sizes are limited to 4 people  in auction madness theres a set time that you have a live auction for all 16 teams remaining in the tournament  all 4 managers are given 100 in play money to bid on the 16 teams  important each manager will end with exactly 4 teams meaning if you are the highest bidder on the first 4 teams you cannot bid any more for the rest of the auction so manage your budget accordingly  


the auction  
the auction is a live event and has a designated start time  the auction will start even if you are not there so make sure youre there on time to be able to participate  auctions for this event should take about 15 minutes  in it a team is selected at random to be bid on and when the time expires or everyone else has passed the team is awarded to the leading bidder  if all managers pass or no bids are placed the team is put in the back of the line and a new team is selected  


scoring  
in auction madness points are denoted with a dollar sign  even though there is no money at risk or in play  it is a free website  if you choose to set up a separate private room you can adjust scoring but for our public rooms the scoring works as follows  
 all swiss games are worth 6 points each bo3s are treated as one game  
 all 8 teams that make it to the ko stage earn an additional 7 points  
 the 4 teams that win the quarterfinals earn  an additional 15 points  
 the 2 teams that win the semifinals earn an additional 24 points  
 the worlds winner will earn an additional 38 points  


for example a team that goes 23 in swiss and is eliminated will earn 12 points  


a team that goes 31 in swiss and is eliminated in the semifinals earns 40 points broken down as  
 6 points per swiss win  18 points  
 7 points for making it to the ko stage for a total of 25 points  
 15 points for winning in the quarterfinals for grand total of 40 points  


im very excited to share this with you all and really hope you enjoy it  ive joined one of our public rooms if youd like to join my group follow this invite link

first and last day of each pass counted as half a day independent of hours used on that day

if there is not a small 2nd set of missions coming they usually announce them prior on the event page though then this post will be accurate 

on a positive note the event is on the longer side this year again after being relatively short last year

i just wish we would finally get some consistency from riot after passes being around for years

you cant go into the shop and buy the pass while knowing 100 that this pass will have the same value as the last pass cause riot is always trying to sneak in small nerfs which will add up over years

"just finished a game as adc with yuumi support i say support because she was never bot lane with me from the start she attached to our top and i was forced to 1v2 on bot then our top decided he will go bot with that yuumi and i go top to make me 1v1 and they will 2v2 as soon as they get bot yuumi went mid and stayed on our midlaner for the rest of the game making sure that basically all lanes lost   
how do i report that she wasnt flaming she end up 081 but its because the midlaner was doing poorly being behind in levels because of her so technically she wasnt running down and inting",Bad Teammates

"hi i recently got into league of legends and while the game is great i really like being able to exit full screen without leaving the game so while using practice tool in the settings i switched to borderless did nothing and then windowed which crashed my game  
i got booted me back to the client locked into the screen with reconnect being the only option other than social profile and settings and unfortunately you cant change the game settings for the screen mode unless youre in game after trying to reconnect id get black white window which would bug out and have to be force closed after not responding

"i am plat adc playing for 15 years mostly kaisa so i guess gold from every other year i know im not great just enjoy playing mobas

my understanding of the lane is that it is the supports job to enable allies to get gold and contribute with low econ to the team with vision and cc or buffs  

i tend to get annoyed when i get a support like swain who i feel is usually playing for themself trying to carry the game and mostly relies on the opposing lane playing poorly getting caught in his really slow cc

i get told i have main character syndrome and yes i feel that the best way to win usually is to play through bot and dragon stack but i dont expect mid and jgl to help my lane a ton every game and understand jgl weaksiding me and play my best and only mention if they harass me about performance  but i dont understand queuing as support and not playing with the goal of enabling your adcteam and playing for yourself

am i right to be annoyed at a support playing for themself or is it my job to try and be an enabler for them

"have any of you also noticed that playing without tp in top makes it very hard to get a good back timing i get the impression that even after getting a kill there is barely enough time to shove a wave properly and if the opponent has tp i end up getting stuck in lane more often than before never mind getting turret plating which are also now lower value the change is meant to counter snowball but it feels like i am being punished for securing a kill thoughts

"this applies to basically every lane since it feels like you can count the characters without attack speed boosts on one hand these days but toplane in particular suffers it used to be i almost never bothered taking ignite top as i prefer cautious play and working with my team but now leaving lane for any purpose  including actually just getting killed  results in your opponent getting even more of a gold lead and most likely knocking your tower down to near half hp 

its even worse if someone as demolish just defend your tower from someone who just got a huge gold and xp lead on you demolish plus an attack speed boost or something else that can wreck a tower like nasus good luck

"hey 

i play pretty much league and would call myself a jungle main 

first off i do agree jungle was broken for the last few months maybe years but the new changes took away all the fun it takes ages to clear your jungle and you as a jungle are now permanently busy with farming your camps i guess that this is fine as you have less oportunity to gank but at the same time if you power farm you will be behind in gold to all laners 

i talked to a few friends and they got a similiar feeling

i thought that maybe it would be a great change to drastically lower the gold and xp a camp can give at the same time decrease a camps hp and resistances and respawn timer 

that way the satisfactory level is way higher as you are still busy farming but dont feel like playing the game in slow motion at the same time jungle tracking becomes a more important skill as a jungle can rotate way more and more importantly currently you have to perma farm as catchup xp is lowered and you can fall behind 12 lvls in jungle just by ganking but because clearing takes so long you have just small time frames with long pauses where you are able to access a specific lane with my proposed changes you would have more but smaller timeframes you could use for a gank but because of the higher clear speed a good jungler can take your whole jungle on the other map side in the same timeframe 

maybe i am too low elo but i think those changes would massivly improve satisfaction levels in jungle because currently clearing camps takes all the fun away atleast for me

"seriously every time i see this thing on my games he completely runs away with the match once he gets rylais and a couple passive stacks rylais being a completely different issue that i feel should be addressed at some point by giving it a cooldown or something

hes at a 5227 winrate on emerald according to ugghttpsugg and has been hovering around that winrate for literal months every time ive checked how is that winrate ok for such a straightforward sit back and farm up champion pick rate isnt anything super low 38 seems pretty standard in such a contested lane full of different picks

like maybe if his god status was delayed a little bit id understand but unless he plays like a total ass and permashoves while being camped by the enemy jungler this dick always seems to hit his supernova by minute 15 of the game at which point good luck winning any teamfight unless your team drafted malph amumu vladimir taric mf or some bronzodia bs like that

yes i am salty and yes i am biased but seriously am i missing anything how is this champion fair or balanced atm what are any actual meaningful weaknesses that can be exploited to set him back severely or anything that isnt lol just cc him or lol just camp him 247

"one thing i keep seeing is the random and wrong statement that jinx would have won that fight last patch anyway the passive being stackable doesnt change anything  
first off there are close fights where this passive compeletly throws the game off balance  
secondly its not just about winning the fight she is ending games way too quickly right after a team fight before if she won the fight they got inhib and backed off but now she can insta remove turrets in fact after a team fight jinx is able to takedown turrets faster than she takes canon pre fight

now she did get 2 more buffs this patch 100 gt 105 hp growth and slight base base damage and ad ration on ult 5 seconds off ult as well  
  
but those buffs alone are not strong enough on their own to make it a 2 difference  
lets look at some chartshttpsimgurcomagtwn0wl   
as you can see she has gotten a massive boost of 5 winrate in mid game and that is all due to her getting 5 stacks from a team fight and having the ability to end the game at around 25 minute by insta removing turrets  
   
  
if you look at 1520 to 2530 part of the game length you can see a noticeable curve and slightly reduced game times between those times  
  
now jinx deserved buffs for sure she was one of the worst adcs for sure but the direction of the buff is just toxic  
no champion should be able to remove turrets with that speed just because they won a team fight that they could have done barely any damage and just got 5 assists  
  
in fact hasnt jinxs passive has always been an issue if you give her 1 ad too much she kills 1 person fast enough to turn it into a penta and if you give her 1 less ad then she cant even get any kills at all",Bad Teammates

"hello besties as you may know riot is buffing seraphine support as part of these changes they are reducing her scaling and giving her more early power  which is like you know kinda against her hyperscaling fantasy buuuuut i can accept it a bit so long as we remain a scaling champ but phreak has clearly outlined that they are fine if seraphine mid stops existing as collateral damage since she has a super low lt050 pr in most elos so basically nonexistant already

hohohoewever i think this is a good moment to address the elephant in the room swain

over the years swain support his most loyal fanbase has gotten nothing but changes that helped midlane and top because of incessant whining from mid and top the roles that basically had no playrate right now his pr is at a whooping 1 after what 2 3 jhins funny number of mini reworks

and thats where the changes landed

well no sir i say no sir

we in the support role lost our super cool pull whenever enemy is cc for these mid fans clamoring for mages to hardly even play him anyway and forcing swain into a perpetual 50 wr of oh he is viable not super good tho just because they whined and now dont even want to use him and after all this they still complain about oh i would totally use him you dont get it i actually love swain and wish him to be viable except he is right there he is literally standing there drinking a margarita in midlane waiting for you to come inside his loving embrace and you are just there dumbfounded saying nu uh

wtf 

meanwhile supps playerbase has only grown over the years rising to a near 5pr because we support chads love our draco malphoys dad whose name i cant remember looking ahh crow daddy who probably gives good hugs i say if they dont want him give it to support players again reintroduce cc pull on ally and give him mk scorpions get over here anytime he uses it

anyway thats just my what i think i am looking forward to seraphines changes the q speed buff specially will be so awesome lets go seraqueens

" i just played my first varus game of the patch so i didnt notice sooner that they snuck in change for varus q indicator that was not mentioned in the patch notes together with the range indicator there is now also a projectile indicator normally i dont really mind those kinds of changes but this indicator is really really distracting to me because you have to channel the spell and its there for the full duration like i said things like this normally dont bother me but this is quite a bad qol change in my opinion it doesnt look that bad in the picture but when you play the champ it just feels so off and distracting maybe there is a chance they revert it if not this is actually a thing that sadly would make me not want to play varus

as a short description of my bias i gave cn teams slight odds of winning vs their kr counterparts but also a bit of a higher chance of losing to weaker opponents i considered eu teams a bit stronger than na teams due to bds winning 30 vs gg also my bo1 winning chances are closer to 50 than the bo3 chances for most matchups i didnt consider any matchup to flip odds for a bo1 but i think teams like gam have significantly better odds in a bo1 than bo3s

parting thoughts i found it particularly interesting that mad got higher chances than fnc to classify since i had mads chances of winning each pairing lower or equal to fncs i guess the first matchup really makes a difference

i frequently see people sad about certain mages being pushed out of mid lane because of how the game of league has evolved makes me wonder why we dont see more bot lane apcs i think at this point seraphine and swain prove that its perfectly fine to do you dont really need an adc for objectives anymore since everyone deals so much damage and every role has champions with good single target or attack speed scaling why not take more mages into the bot lane role mages usually scale pretty nicely so why not put them in a place where they have a babysitter that can help them scale and a usually squishy and immobile adc to play around i think more than just seraphine swain and karthus will probably work,Game Balance
"hi im jack j i work fulltime on ai in competitive gaming and so have access to a lot of solo queue data today i decided to write an article for one simple purpose

finding nrg palafoxs genius in his kr solo queue data

tomorrow 19th october 2023 the lcs champions nrg face the lpl 4th seed weibo gaming in the first round of the league of legends world championship

its far too easy to be an na doomist i mean given their record and all however sometimes all you need is a little hope today that hope has come in the form of an offhand comment by xiaohu the wiebo midlaner who described palafox his opposite number in nrg as powerful and seems like a genius

yes this was later more accurately translated to be closer to talented with potential but as i say today is all about spreading the hopium

now i wont be jumping immediately to and so nrg will probably win worlds instead im simply going to try and fuel the fire my fuel in this case is a st tonne of korean solo queue data alongside a desire to answer a very simple question what makes palafox a genius

before we get into the detail heres a quick explanation of the data

data preliminaries

 all data comes from korean solo queue
 a special thank you to trackingtheproshttpswwwtrackingtheproscom who provide me with the solo queue account names
 i am writing this on the 18th october the data on the site below refreshes regularly and so will therefore not match exactly
 statistics are calculated from the players last 50 games to be best reflective of their current elo
 all statistics are adjusted by the players champion pool they are therefore reflective of the player and how they perform above or below the average for their champions
 when quoting percentiles they are being compared to all master accounts not just other professional players
 killsdeaths in the last 10 seconds of a game fountain dives mostly are removed as to not punish regular forfun fountain diving therefore some games will not match exactly what is quoted in a players match history
 you can see all data here itero korean solo queue statisticshttpswwwiteroggprostatistics

now on with the question what makes palafox a genius

i have over 500 statistics to deal with but to start let us keep it simple he currently sits at a respectable 766lp from an impressive 441 games this puts him ahead of his lane opponent but admittedly hes had a few more games to get there

lp and games in kr solo queue 2023httpspreviewredditkbioqcd2dzub1pngwidth462ampformatpngampautowebpamps7b101d5dbc73ae1c2532b2f714d91815cd3e06b6

having spent the last hour studying his solo queue data in an almost stalkerish level of detail there was one theme that stood out among all others

palafox is the kda king

 overall kdahttpspreviewredditi8ye5jfedzub1pngwidth462ampformatpngampautowebpamps55df5f6430152fb5acfda7159456689ca91b824f

remember all stats are adjusted by the champion pool his raw average is lower but he constantly overperforms on kda when compared to other high ranked players who play similar champions

there were several components that makeup his overall kda that stoodout to me

 kda against his lane opponent
 kda in the jungleriver and the impact on objective control
 kd in solo bolos

 kda against his lane opponent

kills  assists on midlanershttpspreviewredditauej9nihdzub1pngwidth497ampformatpngampautowebpamps61249e5ec9295fa803452b40f3af9272e6780d0e

lets start with his kills  assists against midlaners although hes in the bottom third of the elo since solo queue mavericks tend to play riskier than pros he remains competitive with more comparable opponents like g2 caps and xiaohu  faker being an outlier for his passiveness in lane

his genius however may best be seen when you use the above in conjunction with his deaths to midlaners

deaths to midlanershttpspreviewreddit090jpn5ldzub1pngwidth462ampformatpngampautowebpampsce29ff3f7663a7f73c2b3beda5e29093594882e0

xiaohu is killing midlaners at a rate of 33 a game but dying to them at the exact same rate whilst caps is even dying more than he kills them palafox manages to get 34 kills or assists a game on his fellow midlaners whilst only dying to them 23 times a master class in controlled aggression

kda in the jungle amp river

the second component is his kda specifically whilst inside the jungle and river usually these happen during team fights and skirmishes around key objectives like heralds and dragons

kda in the jungle  riverhttpspreviewreddit054bdd0odzub1pngwidth514ampformatpngampautowebpamps40776538c72759ba162891df05a5f565f57dc65c

for this one i use a slightly different statistic than normal rather than looking at a kda ratio i instead add up all his kills  assists in the jungle and take away his deaths

the conclusion is really selfexplanatory palafox seems to just be better than xiaohu at team fights in the jungle i really cant be budged on this conclusion sorry

you may also be wondering given his absolute dominance in jungle team fighting do his teams tend to secure more dragons and heralds

again i use a slightly different metric here rather than looking at the raw amount of monsters killed i look at the net value if your team takes it you get 1 if the enemy takes it you get 1 and if no one took it you get 0

data note i include dragonsheralds that the player did not directly assist with since there are plenty of ways of helping your team secure an objective without needing to be directly involved

with palafoxs exceptional jungle team fighting he is able to help his team secure dragons and heralds far above the average and certainly above xiaohu

solobolo kd differential

as our final statistic let us now look at how many solobolos he averages per game and how that compares to his solobolo deaths

solo bolos kdshttpspreviewreddit7hktw6k3ezub1pngwidth796ampformatpngampautowebpampsc1c3ae835a279ac1419b06be940a61af471b21c7

if you look closely at the table you can quite quickly see that nrg are going to beat weibo tomorrow at this point its a mathematical fact xiaohu is only managing 139 solo kills a game but is getting solo killed 127 times our boy palafox not only manages to get more solo kills 148 hes also doing it whilst being solo killed considerably less 081

to conclude

through my research and writing of this brief solo queue analysis i have become increasingly confident that nrg will be beating weibo tomorrow this will come almost exclusively through an absolute monstrous midgap which will unfold a little like this

 xiaohu in a desperate attempt to show his prowess will make a number of failed plays against palafox who will happily take the free kill or assist whilst safely farming his lane
 around the 810 minute mark both teams will collapse around herald where nrg will emerge victorious after an almost flawless team fight from their midlanerhuffs the last tin of copium
 although nrg are ahead at this point its not until a monstrous solo bolo from palafox onto xiaohu and the subsequent baron does the game become a complete onesided stomp followed by a 27minute final push

"in the past few weeks me and a few friends been dabbling into some other games and came into our attention on why games like league wild rift and dota 2 have features like   


 more in depth playerchampion stats
 pregame item purchase
 characterskin 3d model visualization
 maprift customization
 better player profile customization
 custom announcer packs

but pc league has a lackluster version of these or not even even that   


wild rift that is made by riot has really cool looking animated and interactive champion 3d models that you can examine but this is non existent on pc league dota 2 customization of your game is miles ahead of league with custom vo for announcers rn during the international they have several announcer packs from casters and community members from different regions to purchase map skins ui skins custom profile layouts and so on and the amount of stats data that you can access in dota 2 is immense in comparison  


im aware that league has way more pressing issues with its serviceclient that need to be addressed first for example its been almost 800 days and the br server still has account transfers blocked but my question is   


with the large amount of funding that riot has enough to fund multiple games wild rift legends of runeterra tft league stories games project l league mmo etc hollywood level production of shows arcane arcane season 2 musical productions with several famous artists lil nas x new jeans twice gidle imagine dragons etc then why when it comes to its main core game they seem to not add new features its taken multiple years for them to allow us to choose a different language of the client in league this is coming in november qol and customization stuff that riot themselves implemented to its other games under the same ip

ive been playing since season 7 and its always been toxic lets not pretend otherwise but we used to have banter funny exchanges and overall respectful interactions trolls will be trolls but the average player would generally act like a real person even when losing nowadays i only see the worst of the worst in players the ones who still communicate at all anyway if i start off with a good morning or glhf i get answered with slurs and mean wishes and if i get outplayed and compliment my opponent i receive a stfu youre so trash to the face theres just no respect for ourselves and each other anymore

all in all i just want to know peoples thoughts on why that is have we just pushed away anyone normal and this is whats left is the games design that makes us behave like this have we all just slowly get turned into goblins interested to see what people think

jungle followup jungle followup isnt listed here but we plan on returning the ad ratio to the pet and adjusting some of the healing values our short term plans are to get the within role balance back so the different classes and the champions within them are each viable again 

belveth were trying to buff e a bit especially now that its worse at early ranks without further encouraging a few points q gt e max 

hecarim hec was disproportionately hit by the blue pet changes were adding some basead back to get him more onto sheen builds rather than lethality

ksante lots of bugfixes for ksante increasing damage in all out form and lowering cast time on q with hp purchases

leblanc buffs to w as her bread and butter spell and e as the spell that has more gameplay

aurelion sol taking some amount of damage out of tap qs and moving more towards the burst qs in addition to moving some damage out of level scaling and into rank scaling

briar were a bit of power out of her statcheck she should still be good at it while retaining lane briar being reasonably powerful

cait discussed cait yesterday but we think lethality cait shouldnt be her most powerful build

jinx this change should allow jinxs passive to still result in those unleashed moments while capping some of the high end cases that seem a bit much

rammus taking his damage down a bunch through both w converting to resists and early q damage with the pet resist synergies this should also reduce clear time by some amount

brandzyra some small adjustments to get a few more mages and aps into the jungle not trying to displace their main roles

seraphine through their pickrate seraphine players have expressed their desire to play her in the support position this doesnt mean that were making midbot seraphine dead but trying to narrow the gap between them 

hullbreaker we opted to pure nerf hullbreaker as it is degrading some side lane patterns a bit much needing to buy hullbreaker to match another hullbreaker is not a particularly desirable pattern  httpstwittercomriotphroxzonstatus1714457786405548502

her gameplan is really simple you farm until like dirk once you have it you delete 4050 hp of squishy enemies like lux this makes snowballing extremely easy even if you dont get the kill youl gain tons of gold with first strike

i watched the games back over since that schedule is leaving me delirious at 430 am trying to finish watching the series

its incredible to me that leading up to worlds theres always so much talk around mid and adc players and who will carry hardest but after watching those games back over two of those games were lost had labrov not played the way he did

hes playing with an underwhelming adc and still finding angles game 4 he rotates top at lvl 4 to kill jax and get adam ahead the entirety of game 3 he was finding crazy hexflash angles and making sure he was aware of his adc and perfect peeled in so many situations even in the losses hes trying so hard to get crownie gold or peel for nuc rotating to adam to try to get him ahead or help save his lane wave state  watching him take the right traps to allow for his team to path flanking to provide pressure on the enemy carry and even walk through lanes to pull waves or stop a shove by just tanking for 23 seconds

"i might be a niche part of the player base but hear me out 

let me start with im part of the sad regions that do not have normal draft so if quick play straight up removes blind pick i will not have a ranked option on summoners rift apart from quick play 

im one of those players who plays fill in normals and likes to match my champ to my team comp i play most roles equally as badly so it doesnt really matter  however quick play taking over blind pick seems quite worrying for me the whole shtick of my friend group is we are all fill players and depending on the mood we all swap out our roles and champs or play with knowledge of what our new guest friend is picking 

 quick play may remove this from my friend group and we usually play as a group of 3 and 4 so playing ranked flex isnt a consistent thing to do i can play soloq when playing alone  

this wouldnt be an issue if there was any other normal play mode but saying it will completely replace blind pick is quite worrying for me will smaller regions only have quick play  or will smaller regions finally have two normal modes",Bad Teammates

"okay trust me the title doesnt say the full picture of my thoughts im a lpl fan and i do think lpl should be the slight favorites for this worlds because of this insane jdg team and great lpl summer split but i think im unlike other lpl fans that im not confident about the overall lpl showing at all and this is because of the swiss stage a lpl team implodes in worlds every single goddamn year and im honestly getting a bit traumatized by it feels like ever since 2020 every lpl team gets rated highly coming into worlds but 1 or 2 teams shit the bed in group stage while lck gets every team in quarters im tired of this expectation just to feel depressed in group this year swiss stage so im fully expecting wbg and one of blglng to not make it at this point if they all do ill be very pleasantly surprised and happy but im not expecting it 

but once lpl reaches the knockout stage im very confident in them i thought that edg could genuinely win vs dk when they were huge underdogs i thought rng were as good as t1 when the 180 t1 roster was considered by fans to be the greatest roster ever

the crazy thing is that i think lpl has a much higher chance of winning worlds than actually getting all 4 teams into knockout stage the scrims rumor so far support this happening again as well im not one of those ppl who think scrims dont matter well its fair if you do but the current scrim rumor is that the best scrim teams are all lck teams and jdgg2 all lck teams and the chinese 1st seed in semis has happened for the last 2 years albeit due to different reasons such as cn vs cn in quarters and fpx drama but it doesnt inspire confidence

so lpl fans how do you stay so confident i need some of that copium i think western fans were the ones that needed copium but i need some rn ill not be happy if its the jdg and lck show and jdg wins worlds",Bad Teammates

players who are browsing reddit are engaged more than rest of the player base same with watching youtube or twitter i dont know if you remember but sometimes there are justifications for some changes to a champion like olaf with ult change a while back many more with most recent being jinx those changes are made to not buff the champions power in particular but to make their fantasy stronger for the player so i wonder why are some champions allowed on the rift while others are stuck in the basement take for example jinx her power fantasy for most players would be her aoe rockets and crazy speed from passive jinx being a pro issue in the past zeri power fantasy for most zeri players would be her aoe and speed steroid from ult zeri being pro issue too both are similar in their fantasy but with different conditions jinx needing to score takedown while zeri has to stay in combat otherwise she runs out of juice so how come one champion is praised to the sky being arguably broken right now and the other had her knee caps broken with a sledgehammer,Champion Design

"over the past 6 months ive been compiling all of my normal draft games over time i started seeing 2 distinct trends over 80 of all of my games consists of premade groups of at least 3 but more often 45 roughly 60 of my games contains a player at least 2 entire tiers above my entire team 

this has created an environment of complete one sided stomps in the rarity that my team is the premade or the higher ranked player my team then does the stomping even games are extremely rare

at first i gave the benefit of the doubt for this situation maybe my mmr was high maybe i was toxic and got in a group of other toxic players maybe all this stems from the past when all my friends used to play together the issue is all that has been over with for a long time im now back to honor 4 and have cut all the things i used to do to get restricted on this account my friends stopped playing over a year ago and ive been solo since

so my next thought was okay maybe our normal mmr just matches their normal mmr that would make a lot of sense if i saw these platemeralddiamond players playing an off role or a champion they werent used to however more often than not not only is this not the case but they are usually on one tricks or very high mastery champions

now for the interesting part i made an alternate account specifically to one trick a champion for ranked without having all the ranked anxiety on my main account the result games like league used to be back and forth leads with interesting fights and a lot of skirmishes no one sided stomps or toxic one tricks that are 123 tiers higher than our team everyone genuinely working together to win all the 5 man cheese coming out of a random bush is gone no more breathing in the jungle and 17 people showing up

ive put a lot of games in over the past 6 months and no matter what i do it shows no sign of improving this leads me to believe my main account has some sort of flag or issue with it to cause this kind of setting

is anyone else getting the same circumstance if so how widespread is this problem its frustrating as a silver player to queue up and get a 5 stack with 2 plat one tricks on it absolutely wiping the floor with me and my team what can be done to fix this if it is a widespread issue will this issue persist in riots new blind pick replacement mode",Bad Teammates

seriously its a mystery to me how ivern has managed to avoid this treatment

ampx200b

when other champions start seeing too much play in any other lane theyre almost always nerfed right away especially if it is a support going into another lane pyke mid karma midtop sona top and bot janna top seraphine bot camille jungle kalista top etc all of these are other examples of champions seeing viability in other lanes who were then forcefully taken out of those lanes why is that not okay but seraphine who is an absolutely awful support gets moved into support because people decided they wanted to play her there

ampx200b

am i salty because seraphine mid is probably effectively dead in the water next patch absolutely i am a support player and honestly im sick of seeing random cheese show up in the role only for it to be accommodated to but when supports show up in other roles its almost always swifty nerfed i mean seriously how many supports have undergone a lane swap that has received serious attention allowing them to stay there kench maybe morgana jungle maybe brand his winrate is 2 higher midlane i guess its still sub 50

ampx200b

a new support comes out and theyre basically plastered with little kinks that prevent them from ever seeing play in any lane other than support because the champion design team is absolutely terrified of renata glasc making an appearance in mid lane but theyre just fine with turning every other artillery mage into a support its seriously a miracle neither zoe or taliyah have been reworked into supports at this point considering their overall aestetic",Champion Design

"hello everyone in the midst of all the drama around the games balance i came up with a fun challenge inspired by some of polypuffs recent videos feel free to try it out for yourselves and let me know what you think about the challenge or the video

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2cporxnhlnmhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2cporxnhlnm",Game Balance
"there is a tension between using a global ban outside of your role and using a local ban specific to your role for instance if youre a toplaner and you ban a strong jungler or youre a support who bans a strong midlaner so how about if each team could ban one champ from each of the three center roles without doubling bans to 2 per player too many imo

in s1 each team had 2 bans followed by 3 bans shared by the whole team the current sweet spot of 1 ban per player is quite nice this proposal would take the 3 shared bans and add them to the current 1 ban per player as an alternative to the status quo or to doubling the amount of bans to 2 per player which imo would be too many

however these 3 shared bans would be split among 3 roles one player is given dictatorship of the 3 shared bans however they can only select a ban that is suggested by the other 4 players

when a player is in the ban phase they select several champions to add to a temporary banlist the ux would resemble the current suggest ban except also show a history of champions hovered over during the ban phase banlists can also be saved and imported like runepages so you wont have to search champions every time the one they are currently hovering over is highlighted and perhaps a slightly larger icon that is still smaller than preselect icon

after a short delay simultaneously your personal ban is locked in for your team and then suggested ban list is finalised the dictator is then given 10 seconds to choose from the aggregated ban list each players banlist is at most 3 champions long so the dictator has up to 12 champions to choose from if any champion has 2 suggestions without being preselected they are automatically banned without the dictator choosing if 2 champions are tied for the role ban then the dictator chooses between them

why not top and support personally i feel like the flavour of toplane is one of uncomfortable matchups and being an island that needs help but cannot receive enough jungler attention or conversely is an island where you stomp the opponent but the enemy jungler cannot afford more assistance without worrying about a global ban eg jungler midlane assassin youll always have a toplane ban for yourself two toplane bans would harm the lane vibe too much similar story with botlane since it now receives up to 3 bans 2 personal bans  1 adc roleban

"there is no point in trying to play agressive and kill your laner early anymore they made doran items way better so champs that like to start longsword and rush first item are weaker they nerfed respawn timers so that if you kill someone early they can tp a few seconds later with a good wavestate and actually come out ahead of you for some reason they buffed orianna and syndra even more just play scorch aery orianna or syndra midlane and no one will be able to outpoke you or beat you in lane and even if someone does beat you and make you run it in lane killing you multiple times you still outscale them they nerfed every single early game runeaery only good one they even nerfed turret plating gold

riot has massively slowed down the pace of the game and mistakes are way less punishing they slowed the game down so much that even useless overnerfed champs like aurelion sol that loses to everyone in lane is getting nerfed where does this leave early game champions like talon that were already weak before this patch and are now even more terrible",Champion Design

"tldr gold should be displayed in game current champ power comparisons dont give good information and players get wrongly flamed for bad kda if theyre impacting the game well by other means estimating power levels without a gold display isnt fun skill expression and there would still be skill expression in comparing matchups and golditemslevels 

why hide stats to make it harder to tell whos actually winning the game currently we have to compare items look at cs and look at kda to tell roughly how much gold a player has and this still isnt the most accurate pro games already have gold display since its important to know whos likely stronger in fights this doesnt mean we should get rid of cs kda or item displays just show gold as well

 cs isnt a very good indicator of anything all it does is tell you roughly how well youve been playing your lane compared to your opponent or how close you are to optimal 10csm it gets especially worse when compared to jungle since camps dont track cs in a similar way this sometimes results in players flaming junglers or junglers flaming everyone else for misunderstanding how cs works
 tower plate gold is completely impossible to track unless theyve spent it on items if two laners cs are the same you might think theyre doing the same in lane but if one has gotten 4 plates theyre actually way stronger you can look at each turret pre14 minutes to see plates taken but after 14 minutes good luck
 comparing items is the biggest chore of all you have to look at each item compare to components compare to boots and compare the prices of items im not sure anyone can perfectly calculate gold from peoples inventories especially ingame when time is sensitive therefore its only a rough estimation of someones power especially since full items vary widely in price anywhere from 2100g to 3600g
 kda is the most stigmatized stat and probably the one most used to quickly check a players current power however its one of the worst indicators since assists vary a lot in the amount of gold they reward and shutdowns are all over the place ive often seen toplaners be 25 so my team underestimates them not realizing theyve gotten plates towers and lots of shutdown gold making them easily as strong as the 105 adc kda is also the root of lots of flame from even experienced players misunderstanding the impact a player has on a game 
 say what you want about thebausffs but hes a good example of how kda doesnt always translate to game impact hes a multiyear challenger players whos gotten rank 1 before with a unique playstyle of trading his life for perfect cs tower plates towers and tower damage hell often have lots of deaths and very negative kda but still be the most fed player in the game
 shutdowns objective bounties and laners taking random jungle camps makes gold even harder to track why be forced to estimate it all the time why not just give this type of information

the only argument i can see in favor of keeping a gold display out of the game is skill expression but to those who feel that way i ask is estimating gold amounts a fun way to express your skill there are already a million fun skill expressive aspects of league like champion mastery item builds macro strategy game knowledge etc if gold was displayed youd still have to estimate a players actual champion strength relative to yours can a 5000g level 13 jax beat a 6500g level 12 master yi youd still have to compare levels items especially defensive items and champion matchups in my opinion hiding those gold values doesnt make this power comparison any more interesting in fact i believe displaying gold will open up the playerbase to more diverse strategies for getting ahead in game saving them from getting wrongly flamed for having a bad kda if theyre impacting the game well by other means",Game Balance

"just played this game and i find it so frustrating that with 83k dmg and 23 kills there is no way in hell im able to carry this team toplane had a rough matchup into teemo but still did decent blitz hit his hooks zac tanked what he could but often left me and jinx alone vs rammus  


jinx on the other hand did nothing this game for some reason this emerald player did not think that buying infinity edge was a good choice so instead opted for stormrazor   


yes i could have built liandrys to do some max hp dmg but it would then hurt my damage against the carrys how can rammus be able to carry this team just because he is a tank while the xerath with 23 kills cant make a dent in his hp

if its not a rammus that stand 1v5 and wont die its a yone splitpushing with hullbreaker that needs 2 people to stop tanks and bruisers are just too strong to the point other classes dont stand a chance

in this case we lost in draft since we would have been forced to pick an adc like vayne with  hp damage or some other champion who can handle rammus since my spells do minimal damage unless i focus my whole build around him and jinx kills herself if she autos him

when other champions start seeing too much play in any other lane theyre almost always nerfed right away especially if it is a support going into another lane pyke mid karma midtop sona top and bot janna top seraphine bot camille jungle kalista top etc all of these are other examples of champions seeing viability in other lanes who were then forcefully taken out of those lanes why is that not okay but seraphine who is an absolutely awful support gets moved into support because people decided they wanted to play her there

ampx200b

am i salty because seraphine mid is probably effectively dead in the water next patch absolutely i am a support player and honestly im sick of seeing random cheese show up in the role only for it to be accommodated to but when supports show up in other roles its almost always swifty nerfed i mean seriously how many supports have undergone a lane swap that has received serious attention allowing them to stay there kench maybe morgana jungle maybe brand his winrate is 2 higher midlane i guess its still sub 50

ampx200b

a new support comes out and theyre basically plastered with little kinks that prevent them from ever seeing play in any lane other than support because the champion design team is absolutely terrified of renata glasc making an appearance in mid lane but theyre just fine with turning every other artillery mage into a support its seriously a miracle neither zoe or taliyah have been reworked into supports at this point considering their overall aestetic",Champion Design

so i see many many builds with void staff and lord dom and other magic and armor pen items in those builds but is it still recommended to build it if they have 1 or no tanks in the enemy team for example if the enemy team is not building any magic resist or maybe one enemy is building mr would it still be recommended to build a void staff or can i build another item instead that would be more efficient thank you ,Bad Teammates

"recently watched this video of a professional player raging about how yone loses to fiora level 1 and how the game isnt balanced because it wasnt close this line of thinking and blatant whinging really bugs me and i want to explain why video below   
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbygby2diw1wamplcugy6cdbla1_kubf9114aaabag9vqhww97ee79vyslz8gamchttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbygby2diw1wamplcugy6cdbla1_kubf9114aaabag9vqhww97ee79vyslz8gamc  


now im not an esports pro but i play a lot of league i think its rather common knowledge that fiora has one of the strongest level 1s in the game next to tryndamere and darius in this video you will see fiora engage into the yones caster minions to proc a vital the yone immediately responds with his q and follows up with autos to begin stacking lethal tempo they both begin to kite out the fiora kites away from his minions and yone begins to kite into the fioras minions yones lethal tempo gets fully stacked and utilizes auto resets with q to dish out a lot of damage while fiora does the same while also procing vitals the 1v1 ends when fiora predicts the yones flash at the beginning of her auto attack animation securing the vital proc at the end of her auto attack animation   


the argument from the pro is that the 1v1 was not even close and the game is clearly not balanced at all because the fiora was tanking the yones caster minions clearly tanking caster minions in a 1v1 at level 1 means you should auto lose according to his logic while it is true fiora took more aggro than yone here the yone still took plenty of aggro himself and also doesnt have bone plating like fiora does which is has a huge impact early game on all ins   


personally i find it really disingenuous for a few reasons here and ill explain why its rage bait 

1 professional players should know that champions have power spikes at different levels a champion may be weaker earlier than they are mid to late game and vice versa i note this because again fiora has an extremely strong level 1 because of her passive and yone has what lethal tempo and q professionals should not advertise that all champions should be of equal strength at all levels of the game even if that means 1 champion can tank 6 more hits from minions at level 1 
2 no one wants a game where all champions are of equal strength at all stages and period of the game people obviously want to be able to have an advantage over others at certain time to push advantages because of this there will always be a champion that is stronger than another champion at level 1 even if that means tanking 6 more hits from a caster minion 
3 even if the yone did more damage level 1 or fiora has less base health level 1 should the yone be expected to win despite not guarding his vitals the yone decided to all in instead of backing out he did not guard his vitals using terrain nor did he win the flash prediction the fiora played it well enough to proc the vitals why should fiora lose anyway when she executed the function and identity of her champion while yone doesnt even have any crit yet of course later on in the game it might be impossible to use terrain to block vitals which is why later on in the game it is more about the number of vitals procd 

this kind of complaining without acknowledging the differences in champion and game mechanics is completely dishonest and does not help people playing the game actually understand how and why a champions should win fights i would expect high elo players to already know that fiora wins level 1 and instead of kiting into her minions and committing to an all in where you didnt even get the first hit in kiting back to the safety of the tower or at least staying near your minions to keep that advantage it was really only when the yone committed to the fight and started taking minion aggro himself that he lost the fight in this kind of high elo match up yone shook hands with fiora and agreed to the fight ",Champion Design

after the round one bracket draw there is a  636  chance that at least one western team makes it out of the swiss stage without ever beating an eastern team the chance for two teams is 07 the very small hopium chance of three is gone 

after looking more deeply at potential first round draws the bad first round draw ends up not being too bad because after this round were getting a round of east vs east and west vs west matchups round two draws end up not mattering as much for the same reason the biggest swings in probability were in round 3 and onward draws

 bds   957   957
 gam   706   706

i used as input the first round team pairings and two tables for bo1 and bo3 winning odds for every pair of teams the table can assume different redblue odds per matchup i added a restriction such that two teams cannot play each other more than once i couldnt find the complete rule set after a quick search but this is a standard restrictions in swiss tournaments i used my personal bias to create these tables so take any results with a pinch of salt

as a short description of my bias i gave cn teams slight odds of winning vs their kr counterparts but also a bit of a higher chance of losing to weaker opponents i considered eu teams a bit stronger than na teams due to bds winning 30 vs gg also my bo1 winning chances are closer to 50 than the bo3 chances for most matchups i didnt consider any matchup to flip odds for a bo1 but i think teams like gam have significantly better odds in a bo1 than bo3s

parting thoughts i found it particularly interesting that mad got higher chances than fnc to classify since i had mads chances of winning each pairing lower or equal to fncs i guess the first matchup really makes a difference

good luck with your pickems

"potentially unpopular opinion as people start doing their pickems for swiss just remember to not default to thinking like it is double elim as an example it is possible for mad to make it to quarters by beating 3 na teams and upsetting blg in a bo3 similarly its possible for na to completely dodge major eastern regions although the faith in na is already low beat each other and then beat mad in a bo3 on the flip side g2 or fnc could be tasked with playing only eastern region teams who knows what will happen

how is possible that this champion now has zero down time lane phase with new death times makes getting plates and trying to shove waves impossible against the champion hes always perma up with tp and his ult how is it that i kill his champ wait out his passive and shove a wave for a recall just for him to have a wave under my turret before i get back to lane pls make it so that his death timer doesnt start until his passive expires or something even if i win against it its so unfun to play against and super unhealthy for the game too ,Game Balance
"hi all

a little background on my situation im a multiaccount master tier adc main looking to give something back to the community that i grew up with through solo queue coaching ive tutored both in college and high school but outside of that i have no coaching experience in league or anywhere else i sometimes review vods of my friendsmutuals to help others improve and overall i have a very strong sense of macro knowledge in my particular role i found that there are very few adc educational content creators coaches and resources compared to other roles so i figure the market is open to adc coaches at the moment

i am looking at the first page of google for coaching services and applying to each one i am qualified for however i am a bit stuck on what exactly i should be doing to get prepared so far ive
watched countless challenger adc coaching videos on yt
began setting up a coachify profile

my question is what are the best coaching services right now i should look to be a part of to start as and grow myself as a coach or is building my own service a better option despite a lack of experience what should i be doing to prepare for my first few sessions any additional info is also welcome i am open to any and all resources",Ranked Pressure

note i didnt order them from left to right in there respective tier i dont think they differ muchhttpspreviewreddithlxtv1dmyeub1pngwidth1140ampformatpngampautowebpamps6e95a51ead8bad79d265686bd04cccb3db31be97

im a high ping player myself i based my opinions on how they playable they are from a 90300 constant ping range incase you want to know i myself play on170 ping constant and no packet loss now firstly i think i should explain what i think makes a champ good on high ping there are 5 main things that are challening on high ping in no order  last hitting minionscsing dodging skill shots hitting skill shots executing combos and early game as a whole 

now immediately you may ask why champs like lux who are quite skill shots reliant are in the higher tier the main reason is that they make it up heavily in other categories so looking at luxvexannivianeeko and veigar they all have  extremely good wave clear andor an easier time csing they also arent interactive during the laning phase which means they dont really have worry about landingdodge skill shots as much these champs also have cc that which maybe on a skill shotbut if they do land it they dont have to worry about any of there other upcoming abilities since it a stationary target which is alot better than having to poke trade on a constantly moving target 

in reality though most league players will never get to a rank where high ping  100200 range  makes the game impossible since its may not exist just look at somone like flyerbekk who managed kata on high ping azzapp who got to chall on velkoz so just play what you enjoy and if you want to give yourself the best chance then you still have the freedom to do that thanks ",Bad Teammates
"i am in iron 3 queueing for top and mid ranked euw and i often have to wait a very long time before the system finds me a match

often it takes 78 mins before they find a match and then clown fiesta starts declined ready check champ select dodges over and over again i have approx 2 hrs in total to play every day  but with these waiting times it is not fun i also experience remakes at least twice a week i wonder if this is a wooden elo thing or just a general lol thing",Champion Design
in other words not having to hold shift when interacting with the minimapui elements or having to disable minimap movement altogether i dont see a point in requiring attack move click to apply to the minimap anyway but at least providing an option to disable it while still being able to move with the minimap would be great ,Bad Teammates
"unironically the current changes are not the worst and they do achieve what they set out do by bringing apc and support closer but the current problem is that all that actually means is apc will be just as bad as support

because she has a bad support kitshe has a long range q that is bad for poking and almost entirely used for waveclearing and in teamfights requires ap to be good

w is way too long cd for being used in lane  still very strong in teamfights but sorakasona just do it better and no real ability to defend 1 person in particular

e requires an ally slowcc  so throwing it out on its own is not the brightest idea and adcs the few that actually have them dont always wanna throw them out just like that either

r is just broken dont have anything to say

my proposition

nerf the ap ratio on q by like 10 instead of 20  might not even need to adjust base damagethis also slows apc from perma clearing waves at 2 components because rn she can still do that very early due to the base damage buffs

same thing with the w heal make it a 002 ratio

and make her q heal allies it hitsseriously why has never thought of this keep the ap ratio to a bare minimum or hell even give it a heal and shield power ratio so it needs support itemsmoonstone to be good you can even keep the lower health gt bigger heal theme that q already has

then seraphine actually has a real use for the q in lane and in teamfights she can heal her frontline while damaging the enemy frontlineand most importantly of all support mythics actually work on her

the current problem with the changes is that they remove scaling from a champion class that literally is supposed to scale heal enchanters have always had insane lategames looking at

sona soraka taric milio nami lulu they have substantial increases in winrate as the game goes on

so what ends up happening is you have a champion with arguably a worse early game than all of the above that also happens to be hard outscaled by all of the above there is only so much of the champion that broken ultimate can carry

obviously this is all subject to number tuning but her kit needs a fundemental change for support to both be and feel good

"full preview 

jungle followup jungle followup isnt listed here but we plan on returning the ad ratio to the pet and adjusting some of the healing values our short term plans are to get the within role balance back so the different classes and the champions within them are each viable again 

belveth were trying to buff e a bit especially now that its worse at early ranks without further encouraging a few points q gt e max 

hecarim hec was disproportionately hit by the blue pet changes were adding some basead back to get him more onto sheen builds rather than lethality

ksante lots of bugfixes for ksante increasing damage in all out form and lowering cast time on q with hp purchases

leblanc buffs to w as her bread and butter spell and e as the spell that has more gameplay

aurelion sol taking some amount of damage out of tap qs and moving more towards the burst qs in addition to moving some damage out of level scaling and into rank scaling

briar were a bit of power out of her statcheck she should still be good at it while retaining lane briar being reasonably powerful

cait discussed cait yesterday but we think lethality cait shouldnt be her most powerful build

jinx this change should allow jinxs passive to still result in those unleashed moments while capping some of the high end cases that seem a bit much

rammus taking his damage down a bunch through both w converting to resists and early q damage with the pet resist synergies this should also reduce clear time by some amount

brandzyra some small adjustments to get a few more mages and aps into the jungle not trying to displace their main roles

seraphine through their pickrate seraphine players have expressed their desire to play her in the support position this doesnt mean that were making midbot seraphine dead but trying to narrow the gap between them 

hullbreaker we opted to pure nerf hullbreaker as it is degrading some side lane patterns a bit much needing to buy hullbreaker to match another hullbreaker is not a particularly desirable pattern  httpstwittercomriotphroxzonstatus1714457786405548502

 nerf support item stats across the board

 make support item an active that marks a main partner reasoning later

 stop passive gold generation outside an ally radius maybe 12k range

 introduce movespeed nerf if outside of main ally radius to reduce roaming power

 grant them the same xp nerfs from minions somewhat what junglers have if not around the main ally

sincerely fix the support playstyle discrepancy most of soloq games early game is decided by which supports brains neuron activates first to tell them to pressure the map outside botlane and the fact they lose literally nothing by doing it is absolutely tragic and it has been so for far too long",Game Balance

on the other hand if i were to use a smurf account in low elo for normals to play with them i would likely ruin the experience yet again for the enemy team so my question is how can i play with my friends so its mostly fair am i basically punished for being better at the game by not being able to play with friends some of them straight up refuse to play with me because they are afraid of facing higher elo enemies any solutions

"earlier today dplus kia released a 30 min video on their youtube page httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo1aj5bccvcihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo1aj5bccvci with pretty lengthy interviews  video clips with each player i think en translations are delayed until next week but here are some highlights

430  dk players submitting worlds pickem

 canyon who will get the most penta kills who did you guys pick
 showmaker i picked deft we have to give him a penta deft never got a penta in his entire lck or worlds career
 deft wow if i get a penta at worlds
 canyon but i picked ruler
 showmaker ah sh to deft he said he picked ruler really we could even run into jdg
 deft ok well im voting for kanavi now

540  question is did you ever think there was a chance you would not qualify for worlds

 deft when summer split ended we were in a really worrying situation but playoffs scrims went really well so after that i felt like we would make worlds 100
 kellin yeah we overcame a lot of issues during playoffs and now worlds scrims are also going super well
 deft i feel like we got a lot closer during in game comms later in the season irl we were always pretty friendly from the start but it took some time to get that same closeness in game for example if a teammate makes a mistake they arent so worried now about how other teammates might react in game

825  excerpts of in game comms during scrims

 kellin canna dont worry bot lane is over were good
 showmaker canna if you can just group and be a warm body we can win
 canna im not sure if i can even do that lol
 showmaker yes you can lol our top wave state does make me want to quit the game though
 i think eventually enemy team ffed the scrim

1818  question is how is the team spirit now

 showmaker after regional finals the team morale has been really good i would say worlds is a really fun experience  compared to lck theres a lot more nerves and a lot more at stake weve all been to worlds before and in order to reproduce for canyondeftsm that amazing feeling when you win worlds everyone is giving extra effort and i think thats contributing to the team spirit
 canna i think our team synergy has improved a lot like were better at matching each others picks and creating a cohesive team comp now
 canyon weve been playing together for like 8 months now so i think our teamwork is really good at this point
 deft i also feel like our drafts are a lot cleaner now than they were in early season

2136 

 interviewer so worlds is the last time the 5 of you will be playing together
 showmaker ye but we could still play together next year the last time well its true ive been at dk for my whole career but i dont know what will happen next year it could even be my last worlds who knows he said this lightly dont take it too seriously all of my teammates coaching staff front office staff and everyone else are really good people and i really want to do well at worlds to pay them back for their constant support

2455  not sure what the question was

 showmaker i do watch foreign leagues  mostly lpl  lec those leagues have a lot more fights like when my teammates and i are watching well go what theyre really going for this fight

2530  is there a player or team youre looking forward to seeing at worlds

 deft theres this player named canyon  he tells me jungle feels stronger than previous patches and i think hes an exceptionally good player so im looking forward to see what he can do this worlds in terms of teams jdg won msi and they also have players who performed well at asian games so im looking forward to seeing them
 showmaker at worlds the player im looking forward to watching is myself
 kellin i want to play against jdg ruler i dont think ive ever won against him so i want to win this time around

they post tier list contents every patch although their contents are based on kr server it sure is very useful

champion tiers are determined based on data from the kr server tiers emerald and above

the criteria for selecting champion tiers is based on the champion pick rate win rate ban rate counter rate and data in high elo rank comprehensively a pick rate of over 05 is required to be in the tier list  


httpslolpsstatisticshttpspreviewreddit7pbtgwwh9wub1jpgwidth1920ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps57500be91d60a6aeab1841803447e227be8c642f

lets start at top if you look at the tier 1 lineup youll be taken aback

aatrox darius fiora yone jax all five champions are tricky to play against well only be able to ban one of them and id probably ban aatrox

obviously the champion that top players have been talking about a lot lately would be yone jax and his friends

aatrox has a 137 pick rate and a 504 win rate looking like a safe first pick champ and able to take the initiative easily compared to the last patch hes lost a bit of momentum what weve expected for top this patch is that champions will decline due to nerfs such as conqueror and grasp of the undyingbased champions are going to have a chance and he wasnt able to get out of the woods 100 hes still a good first pick champ but not a freeforall pick

we mentioned that grasp of the undyingbased champions got a chance this patch a prime example is fiora with a 7 pick rate and a 508 win rate she made it into tier 1 weve seen some improvements in her power curve where her firstcore timing which was a bit elusive has been improved its also a good enough card against aatrox yone and jax

if you go higher up in rank only darius gets down from tier 1 and rumble seems to be taking over so its like the top players preferences are almost somewhat the same however rumble is a difficult pick to use properly unless youre in master tier or higher

on the other hand jaxs data is yet again going astray the changes to the motions this patch have made him smoother to deal damage and weve seen tiers rise despite a bug that will eventually hurt him at tiers emerald and above we arent sure if the win rate changes based on proficiency and its not until you get to tiers master and above that the pick rate is 163 and the win rate is 512 at the end of the day we dont think jaxs tier went up because his damage increased or because his durability got too good but instead we think its more of an increase in convenience than anything else so we think its fair to say that its only going to rate well for more skilled players but like we said beforehand its also a patch version that champions using grasp of the undying have a chance at so jax is a good pick right now

graves is on a roll right now up 11 spots to the top rankings if ad junglers know when to utilize dorans blade and this becomes more widespread we may be able to see a more interesting power balance between junglers for now graves is showing off selfish stats and as of today hes got close to a 25 pick rate and his ban rate is quickly exceeding 20  and yet his win rate is creeping upwards to the point where it negates this disastrous pick rate increase the youmuus buff this patch has really helped graves and the changes to the jungle as a whole didnt really impact graves at all so hes relatively more powerful than before 

champions like graves karthus and nidalee who dont get affected as hard by the jungling changes or even briar and ivern at the top of tier 2 are in a relatively better situation in the case of ivern his pick rate is actually still low at 18 but his win rate is still in the 54 range on the other hand as we pointed out at top the late game value is good 

champs who struggled in solo queue due to weak jungling are getting another chance rammus has a 55 pick rate and a 535 win rate and maokai has a 71 pick rate and a 52 win rate these guys are prime examples instead you need to have really good late game value unless you have outstanding late game value youre still going to be held back by your jungling ability it has to be almost as strong as the power graph youre looking at right now with a late game win rate of over 55

sylas jungle is an interesting case we were wondering if it would no longer be a thing after this patch because jungling is so hard sylas jungle itself is still hard to play this patch but not unplayable we think hes defending his data as other champs have received more damage he has a 69 pick rate and a 496 win rate

for the mid lane weve also picked five tier 1 champs sylas orianna taliyah irelia akali

surprisingly akshan did get a nerf this patch and hes been on a downward spiral but its amazing that hes managed to stay on the edge of tier 1 hes truly a solo queue champion he has a 35 pick rate and a 524 win rate

well give the op mark to sylas he has a pick rate of 134 and a win rate of 505 and hes a champion who should be difficult to pick first but nevertheless hes also playing a lot of different runes so we think he needs to be lit up more well try to put together a sylas featurette video soon from runes to items and playstyles we bet you have a lot of questions

naafiri and neeko even though theyre in tier 2 are champions with very high win rates well keep it simple and just go over their performance stats naafiri has a 27 pick rate and a 536 win rate while neeko has a 25 pick rate and a 529 win rate the difference between the two is that naafiris pick rate has been increasing recently while neekos pick rate is going down but they are both good picks yone is in tier 2 with a 127 pick rate and a 485 win rate he has the second highest pick rate at mid after sylas

after the ad leblanc statikk shiv nerf the devs gave a nudge to go back to ap and they said the compensation patch at the time worked for leblanc on ap items so no additional buffs were needed immediately after the nerf we were told that the statikk shiv leblancs data was chipping away at her stats as a whole were really close to the ap build now and leblanc is still struggling with a 5 pick rate and 458 win rate moving up to tiers diamond and above he has a 45 pick rate and 473 win rate at master and above a 44 pick rate and 447 win rate and and bronze to platinum a 51 pick rate and 454 win rate yes leblanc is very difficult to use at any tier right now and shes still getting picked as the developers have said we wonder if theyll give us another leblanc buff

there are more honey champs than usual since its after a big patch well give ezreal an op mark 275 pick rate 515 win rate a dominant performance no matter how untrustworthy hes been at worlds no other adc is as good as ezreal in solo queue considering that the recentlygoneviral unlimited stacks full as jinx has a 294 pick rate and a 50 win rate you can see how ezreal is putting up right now

the viral champion jinx has made it to tier 1 as of today she has a 35 pick rate and her ban rate is approaching 20 the next patch will include a nerf to jinxs passive stack but regardless its fun and users will want to experience how dope it is so adc players might still lean towards jinx

the buffed ziggs is doing a great job at bot were still cautious about recommending ziggs mid but ziggs bot has definitely become a viable joker pick hes got a 35 pick rate and a 537 win rate and as of today hes even gone above the 5 pick rate maybe without the turret plate gold nerf he ziggs bot meta might have been fully established its still pretty good as it is though hes got to the point where theres no bot champion with a win rate disadvantage

one champion to watch is armor pen miss fortune who is seeing a resurgence with the youmuus buff her pick rate is slightly up from the previous patch but she doesnt seem to be getting much attention the value of miss fortune leading to youmuuscollector seems pretty good so you might want to give it a try

the usual suspects blitz rakan thresh and nautilus are in tier 1 we arent going to give out a bunch of op marks though theyre showing good but not great performances maybe its a different kind of balance 

senna deserves the spotlight shes stepped up once more with a 99 pick rate and 517 win rate she has good lategame value and shes a champion who can adopt items like umbral glaive and youmuus so we think the potential is higher as of today shes already over a 10 pick rate so we think its safe to say shes practically tier 1

maokai who has higher lategame potential than senna has also had a higher pick rate recently he has a 2 pick rate and a 535 win rate so you should consider him morgana got patched and morgana jungle has been getting a lot of attention so her pick rate as support has also increased quite a bit there was a significant increase in her data with a pick rate of 47 and a win rate of 493 however its not a perfect match for the current meta so it has some limitations

i havent played ranked in about 2 years and i was in gold i came back to league a few months ago and just want to learn some new champs in normal but every game there are about 3 emerald players on the enemy team and if not theyre on my team instead and its just them carrying the game its so boring i just want to have fun and not be smurfed on im sure ranked is probably easier than normals these days,Bad Teammates
"ps is a well known youtube channel amp meta sitelolps many rank players and even proplayers take account  
they also have global channel in english so check them out

ampx200b

they post tier list contents every patch although their contents are based on kr server it sure is very useful

champion tiers are determined based on data from the kr server tiers emerald and above

the criteria for selecting champion tiers is based on the champion pick rate win rate ban rate counter rate and data in high elo rank comprehensively a pick rate of over 05 is required to be in the tier list  


httpslolpsstatisticshttpspreviewreddit7pbtgwwh9wub1jpgwidth1920ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps57500be91d60a6aeab1841803447e227be8c642f

lets start at top if you look at the tier 1 lineup youll be taken aback

aatrox darius fiora yone jax all five champions are tricky to play against well only be able to ban one of them and id probably ban aatrox

obviously the champion that top players have been talking about a lot lately would be yone jax and his friends

aatrox has a 137 pick rate and a 504 win rate looking like a safe first pick champ and able to take the initiative easily compared to the last patch hes lost a bit of momentum what weve expected for top this patch is that champions will decline due to nerfs such as conqueror and grasp of the undyingbased champions are going to have a chance and he wasnt able to get out of the woods 100 hes still a good first pick champ but not a freeforall pick

we mentioned that grasp of the undyingbased champions got a chance this patch a prime example is fiora with a 7 pick rate and a 508 win rate she made it into tier 1 weve seen some improvements in her power curve where her firstcore timing which was a bit elusive has been improved its also a good enough card against aatrox yone and jax

if you go higher up in rank only darius gets down from tier 1 and rumble seems to be taking over so its like the top players preferences are almost somewhat the same however rumble is a difficult pick to use properly unless youre in master tier or higher

on the other hand jaxs data is yet again going astray the changes to the motions this patch have made him smoother to deal damage and weve seen tiers rise despite a bug that will eventually hurt him at tiers emerald and above we arent sure if the win rate changes based on proficiency and its not until you get to tiers master and above that the pick rate is 163 and the win rate is 512 at the end of the day we dont think jaxs tier went up because his damage increased or because his durability got too good but instead we think its more of an increase in convenience than anything else so we think its fair to say that its only going to rate well for more skilled players but like we said beforehand its also a patch version that champions using grasp of the undying have a chance at so jax is a good pick right now

      other scalings for 3 bhp and 20 barbmr are still using their post1320 values
  jungle pet healing per attackampnbspampnbsp70 of damage dealt gt 1346 lerp 112
      previously this healing was capped to 1245 lerp 112 to account for the new tank scalings but this is probably redundant now that the healing scales independently although the calc for the cap got updated to the new 1346 values regardless
  the 12 missing health healing from large monsters now appears to be capped to 90 healing requiring 750 missing health

      remindersampnbspampnbspmonster dot damage cap is still unchanged at 80 premitigation per tick and the aoe pop damage is not affected by monster modifiers besides dealing x05 to epics
  previous changes to attack speed and e base damage are still in

 caitlyn
  p crit chance scalingampnbspampnbsp8125 gt 85
      this formula is pretty complicated crit chance and crit damage become additional tad scalings which gives the following results
      base tad scalingampnbspampnbsp60  90  120  1  7  13 unchanged
      additional tad scaling from crit chance no iedgeampnbspampnbsp1421875 gt 14875
          exampleampnbspampnbspat level 13 with 0 crit chance then she doesnt gain anything extra and just has 120 tad scaling if she had 50 crit chance at level 13 then shed now have a 120 14875  05  194375 tad scaling and at 100 crit itd now be 26875 tad scaling
      additional tad scaling from crit chance with iedgeampnbspampnbsp17875 gt 18700
          her crit chance scaling also stacks multiplicatively with crit damage

      bad scalingampnbspampnbsp200 gt 170
      crit scalingampnbspampnbsp35 gt 50

 ksante
  p mark r true damage conversionampnbspampnbsp35 constant gt 45  60  75  6  11  16
      technically this means you will still gain benefit even if you dont upgrade your ult at those later ranks but it might be easier to implement it this way to keep all the data for this effect on the passive instead of splitting some of it off onto the ult
  q cast time buffs from earlier are still in
  w min charge durationampnbspampnbsp065s gt 075s revert to live
      this was mistakenly claimed to be 065s on live when it was actually set to 075s yesterday it was actually set to 065s now its back to 075s
      this does not affect the rw variant which is unchanged from live at 05s
  w max charge durationampnbspampnbsp10s gt 15s
      this also applies to the rw variant

 leblanc
  w damage ap scalingampnbspampnbsp65 gt 75
      rw damage unchanged at 75
  e2 damage ap scalingampnbspampnbsp70 gt 80
      e1 damage unchanged at 35
      re also unchanged at 40 then 80

 morgana
  w base damage per 05sampnbspampnbsp626 gt 628
      total over 5sampnbspampnbsp60260 gt 60280
      reminderampnbspampnbspdamage is amped by up to x27 at 100 missing health but you cant really deal the max damage over the entire duration outside of really specific situations so the math here becomes complicated
  w monster modifierampnbspampnbspx165 gt x170

if u get vs a lot of ranged champs in top what u can pick is yorick or nasus they seem to be pretty good vs ranged nasus has his w which is so good and yorick can also pock with his ghouls,Champion Design
"as title this years playin has been the most exciting and entertaining iteration ever since it was introduced the change of format makes every game matter the losers bracket is a great addition as well for giving teams 2nd chance while maintaining the high stake the lack of lpl and lcks 4th seed in playin also makes games much less onesided as for the results 2 teams from the lower bracket make their miracle run and make it out that was a great storyline to me 

i would also throw in the wqs that acted as a warmup stage before the official worlds starts 

worlds has been going great so far lets hope the next stages are going to be just as entertaining ",Bad Teammates

"i know that visual rank is nothing to do with my mmr but somehow i feel like my mmr doesnt increase right now i have a 63 winrate on pyke in my last 100 games at the start of the 100 games i was playing against average emerald 43 now i finally hit diamond but i still getting matched against average emerald 3 so how can it be i reached diamond but im not playing against a single diamond player the funniest thing is that sometimes there are summoners in my games that never reached anything higher than plat4 in previous seasons

i really dont care that much about visual rank but i was almost every season diamond and some seasons even high diamond the game just made a lot more fun in high diamond because the player are better but somehow riot decided that my mmr shouldnt increase that fast

im really thinking about starting a smurf after about 50 games i will be in high diamond anyway that cant be the solution riot wants can it",Ranked Pressure

"hey guys

well what a banger way to end the play ins even though the reverse sweep killed my crystal ball again  

 no mountain soul out of the 9 games played today which is kinda wild however all the drags are close with cloud slightly ahead 
 kaisa pulled 5 clear of xayah on most picked as well as picking up some needed wins to bring her winrate up to 50
 maokai and orianna are the most banned of playins with 21 each though they are not that far ahead
 we know have 5 champs played in multiple roles those being rell sett poppy taliyah and maokai will we have someone in 3 or is 2 going to be the correct answer
 most deaths is pretty tight with only 20 deaths separating 1st and 9th
 beanj moves clear in first bloods with 4 crownie is currently on 3 with labrov and sheo on 1 each have to see how well they do in swiss
 crownie also took the lead for most kills in a game with 13 this would have been enough for 3rd last year
 we now have 2 categories with results as gam is now the team that advanced the furthest from a 2 or less team region 
 we also now have a reverse sweep so rip me and everyone who predicted 0 there was 1 last year so maybe i shoulda learnt
 no baron steals the whole of play ins wild im hoping we see a lot of steal in swiss d
 lastly its not a crystal ball thing but we have currently seen 58164 champs in champ select so either picked or banned where will we end up

thanks for a great play ins guys im looking forward to covering swiss and hope my crystal ball can be saved cos its not looking good d 

ive also added my pick ems for swiss just so yall can see them

"about every wednesday morning in na riot does maintenance on their servers  now i understand this is necessary and is not a problem but what is a problem is how this maintenance is extended essentially every single time  i am typically up early so i see the planned time when servers are supposed to return  sometimes the servers will go up an hour later or sometimes three hours later than planned but never on time  

my message to riot is to be conservative with your estimates on when you will complete maintenance  it is better to have maintenance set to last longer but to have the servers up earlier than to continually miss the predicted time servers will return",Bad Teammates
i watched some guides where they say you have to open the riotgames folder and create a shortcut of the leagueoflegendsexe and put it on the desktop then you simply can open the replay you want to watch by drag it from the folder where the replays are saved onto the created shortcut but it doesnt work replay and client are from the same patch the screen turns black and it seems to load the replay but then a windows sound occurs and an error pops up which last around 01 sec have some of you guys experienced the same issue and did you fix it if so what did you do to fix it,Champion Design

its been nearly a year since riot removed names from champ select there are more and more people who use lobby checkers especially in high elo as far as i know no one has ever gotten punished for it it seems like you get an advantage from using it with zero risk so whats stopping everyone from using it why doesnt riot just let people see champ select names again,Champion Design

were really excited to see so many people using our site this year and we thought it might be a good time to ask for feedback on our tournamentleague pages particularly our worlds 2023 page

were well aware that our standards and layout differ from other lol esports wikis so there might be elements that feel odd or even confusing or perhaps some things were missing altogether wed really appreciate it if you could share your thoughts on these aspects as it would really help us in making better decisions about our layout for this tournament and for future leagues and tournaments it would help make us a better resource for league of legends esports going forward

hello 

sorry for not being able to post here yesterday 

here are the most notable changes for today

 bds reverse swept psg sorry for those of you who predicted 0 reverse sweeps
 kaisa is now the most picked champion while xayah dropped to 2nd place
 orianna joins maokai as the most banned champion and both neeko and rumble get on the board
 viego makes an appearance as the champion with the 2nd highest wr with 71
 three more champions join rell and maokai as the champions that have been played in more than one role poppy taliyah and sett
 the player with the highest kda category changed completely with all the previous headliners being eliminated from the tournament
 bds crownie is now the player with most kills in a single game with 13 kills
 tw beanj now leads for most first blood kills however as he has been eliminated the most likely leaders are now bds crownie and gam palette
 bds adam and gam levi join bds sheo as the players with more different champions played 7
 bds and gam are now the teams with most different champions played if they manage to stay in the tournament for a while its likely that they wont be overthrown
 we now know that gam is the team from a minor region that made it further into the tournament so if you picked gam congratulations
 we have a new longest game psg vs bds which lasted 4355 just 1 minute and 5 seconds shy from the 45 min necessary for some people to win those sweet pickem points one interesting fact ever since the beginning of the tournament the longest game has been between bds and another team

why do some categories have only 1 or 2 results

i only show ranks that 3 or less playerschampionsteams dispute to keep it simple

why doesnt the image show maokai as been played in 3 different roles

since last year riot counted seraphine who didnt buy a support item but was played by a support player as support im using that precedence as a rule so basically if maokai was played by a support player regardless of having bought a support item or not im going to count him towards being played as a support

see you tomorrow",Bad Teammates
i just want to play some summs with my friends were all silver and under but it is impossible to get into flex queue without seeing at least 1 or 2 players on the other team that are plat or higher how am i supposed to play sums with friends if its just unplayable i get that the flex queue algorithm brings in all players from emerald and under but why i would much rather have a 20 minute queue time and actually get to play than just not play at all because the gap is so massive ,Bad Teammates

"hey everyone

i wanted to do a fun fanmade short story for the coveneclipse universe as its my favourite skin line when i first saw the asol art for suneatereclipse knight in lor and the coven skins that came out recently on lor and lol it inspired me to come up with this story youre about to read i hope some or all of you enjoy the read again its meant to be short and sweet and hopefully the actual coven amp eclipse knights story gets explored some more in the future along with some more skins

 tseison

 the great resurrection  a coven short story

the great resurrection had been halted for too long the coven of the south led by evelynn was busy fighting against sivir and her eclipse knights the coven of the west led by queen morgana was engaged in dealing with the suneater kayles awakening the coven of the east led by syndra was dealing with two unexpected problems nami and jannas disappearance and nilahs betrayal the great war continued to rage on and the support from the witches old gods remained scarce because the slumbering god queen did not create enough of them before she was sealed away in the forgotten temple

now there are whispers of the eclipse knights close to summoning their great deity the suneater aurelion sol to bring an end to the witches and old gods in this final last stand thus it was up to the coven of the north led by illaoi and the god queens prophet who entrusted her to carry her eye to resurrect her and turn the tides of this great war

the forgotten temple was a hidden structure located on top of mount aveth where the texts of the great resurrection and witchcraft were first transcribed along with it being the prison of the first old god the god queen belvethcreator of all her old god spawns and mother to all witches that harness her primordial magic

with no word from the other covens and permission from queen morgana illaoi gwen karma and neeko set out to accomplish belveths greatest task before the eclipse knights and their sun eater god arrived

upon entering the temple the walls were engraved with ancient spells theyd never heard of before and primordial magic resonated out of each of them neeko attempted to place her hand on one of the scribes but the touch magically burned her mind until karma pulled her back to reality as powerful as the four of them may be this magic was beyond their comprehension even for the likes of neeko

up ahead was a statue of belveth in her human form sitting on a throne heavily guarded by eclectic powerful enchantments from chains runes and an impenetrable barrier well at least not in illaois eyes as illaoi held the eye of her god in front of her it began to glow within moments four giant spiritual vines manifested and wrapped themselves around the barrier slowly constricting it until cracks started to appear then without hesitation all four of the vine tentacles combined into one and came crashing down upon the barrier shattering it and causing it to dissipate

it was karmas turn next to handle the runes but it wasnt as simple as waving her hands and hand gesturing them away each rune had to be dispelled individually but as intuitive and powerful as she was she could find the flaws in every enchantment she encountered with a focused resolve and a short window of time she tethered one rune to the others and collapsed them all at once

the chains were next an easy obstacle for gwen to overcome but with a snip and another snip of her giant enchanted scissors against them they wouldnt break illaoi tried her hand at the chains to break them with physical strength but nothing worked gwen took a moment to ponder the chains until an idea struck

she then hurled a needle at each of the chains four corners and began to chant channelling her powers through her giant scissors within moments a dome of mist enveloped the statue and chains she stepped into the mist and became ethereal holding her scissors to the chains again she snipped it and it immediately broke she repeated this action on the other three until they all were gone stepping out of the vanishing dome of mist she looked at neeko as she was nervously standing beside karma awaiting her turn

as confident as they were in neeko and her great power neeko was still anxious about pulling off what was required of her next but her sisters reassured her that she was doing this for all of their sisters who were hunted and killed and she would be the final key in speaking the text of the great resurrection engraved on belveths statue illaoi gave neeko her idol she nodded and as she slowly walked up to the statue her form shifted to that of queen morgana the voice they needed to unlock the final enchantment that bound belveth illaois idol condensed into a smaller size and neeko placed their gods eye into the statues forehead as she began to speak the words the others could sense the air becoming heavy and cold just from outside the tomb illaoi karma and gwen went to uncover what it was

reaching the lobby of the temple to the right of them was a shattered oversized gold mirror the pieces of glass on the ground suddenly pieced themselves together and reformed the mirror it started to glow and within moments stepping out of the mirror was the coven of the west lissandra camille zyra and leblanc

to the left of them a clawlike slash through space appeared and savagely opening the tear wider emerged the coven of the south evelynn cassiopeia ashe and ahri soon after a giant flock of black ravens crashed into the lobby grounds and revealed the coven of the east syndra akali and elise

illaoi and her coven were pleased to see the rest of their sisters still alive and well but the absence of nilah nami and janna piqued their curiosity news of nilahs betrayal and new allegiance to the eclipse knights was unfolded nami and janna however had set off on their pilgrimage to seek greater power to help the witches in the great war and knowledge of their whereabouts continues to be clouded

pleasantries were cut short by the arrival of a dark owl that descended before them just as it landed and transformed appearing amongst them was queen morgana displeased with how reckless the others have become and the secrets others have been keeping her irritation flourished even more at the sound of her voice coming from deep within the hallway to belveths tomb

deep down morgana never wanted to follow through with the great resurrection and knew if beveth returned her title as queen of all covens would be relinquished and she insisted on handling the war in her own way she immediately took to her owl form and went through the catacombs to stop neeko

the moment she arrived and transformed back to her human form she lashed out at neeko with a blast of dark energy but neeko was quickly shielded against it by karma who intervened as the others suddenly arrived in the tomb morgana was seconds away from embracing her true form and dispatching all those who would try to stop her but she was too late and with the last bit of the ritual spoken neeko had succeeded the statue quickly shattered and with it the resurrection of the god queen belveth was complete

belveths human form was benevolent to them all and magically adorned itself in garments she was depicted as extremely beautiful with long white hair pale grey skin and glowing violet eyes an elaborate black and goldcoloured gown manifested onto her body and a crown formed on her head black and red ravens emerged from the magical walls one by one and collided with her back creating a long cloak of feathers

all the witches bowed before belveth all of them except morgana unfortunately she addresses her god queen so poorly but belveth doesnt think much of it as she relishes her return and the breath of life once more before words could be exchanged between the two queens a loud sonic scream shook the temple causing the pillars and ceiling to collapse karma quickly acted and shielded them all from the rubble

but suddenly a shower of stars fell from the night sky and collided with the shield pressuring it to collapse but karma not once showed any signs of wavering that was until a spark of moonlight fired into the temple and destroyed her shield as the dust cleared the witches headed for the entrance and upon reaching it waiting at their doorstep stood the eclipse knights high priestesses lux soraka and seraphine

the witches laughed amongst themselves as the three stood no match against them and the might of their god queen belveth but it soon became no laughing matter as their leaders leona and diana suddenly appeared with aatrox senna sivir nilah sejuani fiora irelia rell and the army of the eclipse knights waiting just at the bottom of the temple

this would be the last stand for the witches this time they knew there was no more running no more hiding and no more gods to call upon belveth began to chuckle as her voice reverbed throughout her temple and she soon began to ascend higher up into the sky as her body started to distort and change into her true form the enormous and monstrous being floated above the temple and glanced down upon the puny eclipse knights that appeared as mere ants beneath her feet

with her third eye  she noticed in the distance a fierce storm making its way towards the temple and hidden within that storm were janna and the thousand pierced volibear at her side as the armies of the elderwood continued to cross the bridge of the murky waterways bordering the elderwood to assist their fellow eclipse knight allies here they were suddenly stopped by the emergence of nami and her giant sea creature the leviathan

their armies were no match against belveth and her followers this time they had come so far only to fail but her attention was quickly drawn elsewhere as the suneater kayle and with her the suneater aurelion sol were descending from the cosmic reaches of space the end of the great war had finally begun

"i created an lol esports bot that among other things announces esports games in your discord server all you need to do is add the bot using this linkhttpsdiscordcomapioauth2authorizeclient_id1033373984110166036amppermissions311385131008ampscopebot20applicationscommands then in any channel use the subscribe command to receive live game announcements you can subscribe to lec lcs and of course worlds

you can see the upcoming schedule too as well as the current standings and even customise the timezone to your server so the schedule is in the correct timezone currently the game starts are announced using the schedule on the lol esports website but soon it will be updated to detect game starts but for the swiss stage and it being bo1 the schedule will still be largely accurate

why threads the bot originally was just for me and my friends as we wanted to hide spoilers from those who didnt wish to see and not spam the main channel so i decided to make a bot to make threads and it works super well its been running through playins and worked nicely not missing a single game thread

"we all know the memes if riot ever made pool party ahri andor lux it would make them enough money to fund the next 30 seasons of arcane however they have elected to keep it in a break in case of emergency glass case for if things ever seem dire for the companygame

well im here to tell you that this is the biggest lie since they said that nexus blitz would make a return in 2022

think about it if riot released a skin that was linked to a state of emergency even if it was a skin youve wanted since the dawn of time would you buy it

of course you wouldnt riot releasing pool party ahri means that league of legends is dying for real this time another big influx of cash wouldnt be able to help them with any underlying issues going on pool party ahri is a sign of the end times

but riot knows this as they are the ones who fabricated the myths of pool party ahri for their own benefit they are the only ones who know of this one simple fact there is no pool party ahri 

they created the idea of pool party ahri as a way to signify to the player base that nothing is wrong at all times for all we know riot was completely bankrupt at the start of this year which caused all of the problems such as the cinematic we got but they had their biggest propaganda piece working overtime for them

riot claiming that league would have its biggest budget ever this year did not do anything to ease the worries of the player base but you know what did the lack of pool party ahri if riot was really in trouble they would have released it by now thought the player base this must just be an unlucky streak and things will go back to normal soon

and we all ate it up we will continue to eat it up riot could be 50 billion dollars in debt from settling workplace harassment lawsuits and pool party ahri would never see the light of day

because pool party ahri doesnt exist 

and it never will",Champion Design

im part of many main communities i saw few things from other communities im not part of for example over a year ago katarina mains complaining that the on hit items and bruisers items were nerfed on them saying that its not possible to play if you cant os and tank at the same time with their mobility but itd be hypocrite to ignore my own community lmao

i think the most popular thing about seraphine mains for other main communities is that we talk a whole lot when theres something we dont like 

be it skins that arent good enough for us or changes that doesnt seem to be that smart in our opinion 

i dont know how far some of us are ready to go for that kind of things but i guess theres bad everywhere and regardless of what i think about this i wanted you to share me what you think of rseraphinemains 

it can be on many topics just be respectful to each others for example i think that being active and expressing ourselves isnt bad especially when the point of many changes and pbe is to collect feedbacks if we love the game we should be allowed to share our thoughts obviously we shouldnt go too far in how to do it

doing some posts about it to respectuflly share our thoughts or making a petition or idk what are okay but really threatening and insulting others is never good

tomorrow they will finally play at worlds stage and it takes them  80 days from qualification and 73 days from finals more than the split was itself we basically could have one more a complete lpl split in this window cant imagine how it feels for players to have such intense spring split msi and summer playing 23 times per week with almost no pauses to then chill for basically 3 month to play at worlds all momentum is lost and not to mention that worlds is on patch 1319  6 patches  ahead of their last competitive experience together

if you assume every team will beat all the teams ranked worse than them and lose to every team ranked better there is still a 50 chance of one of the top 8 teams not making it through if you introduce some random chance to the matches so they arent 100 determined by strength ranking the chance of one of the top 8 teams not making it goes up so the true chance of an upset is gt50

so theres a pretty good chance of one of g2 fnc c9 or whatever team you think is just below top 8 making it through even if they cant beat the best teams some hopium for the western fans going into the swiss stage

ps each of the top 8 individually still have gt50 chance of going through and the other teams have an individual chance of lt50 this post is talking about the aggregate chance of all top 8 making it through or not",Bad Teammates

"i dont get why people are complaining about the quality of solo queue at all game has never felt more competitive it doesnt matter if ur stomping ur lanes anymore riot has made sure that someone on your team will balance the game out for u

it feels absolutely thrilling to watch champion select unfold seeing your solo laners pick some niche pick that theyve surely never picked before merely because theyre on a mental bender after losing last game game shouldnt feel too easy after all what would be the fun in that 

and if everything is going a little to well and youre looking for a bit of a challenge just question mark spam whoever died stupidly and hopefully youll be able to make them question themselves enough to decide you deserve to lose after all

why would you play a competive game if u just want to load in and have easy 1520 min victories when you can have sweat inducing back and forth games that last for 40 minutes with boths teams on soul point juggling the map and hoping that the 6th man on enemy team will do something more stupid than your own teammates to clutch that sweet victory

i love getting home from work sitting down to play my favorite game for a couple hours to relax knowing that the game is in its most fun state ever

it would be boring if i couldnt go to bed on a good 38 lp for the night after 56 games where i felt totally in control of my games

"hey everyone 

mordekaisers rework has now been here for about 45 years crazy huh and i wanted to make a fun little thing for everyone to smile and laugh a bit about the wonders this champion brought us before his rework 

for the people who wouldnt know because its been a long while now prerework mordekaiser was by a very long shot the buggiest character in leagues history with over 350 bugs foundhttpswwwredditcomrleagueoflegendscomments8fcwr7and_to_conclude_the_streak_with_over_300_book enough to make a book out of themhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbahjlgsdya4 

some of them were irrelevant and lots of them were impactful but boring but some of his bugs were downright hilarious and so i want to make people recall or discover these beautiful creations 

so heres a trivia quiz on some of mordekaisers best bugs 

ampnbsp

1 what gameplay difference did mordekaisers skins use to make in 2016

 a they gave his ghosts a chance to turn invisible 

 b they gave dragon pets a leash range 

 c they made his vfx visible through fog of war 

 d they doubled his shield generation 

correct answer gtb they gave dragon pets a leash range  
unlike the other big summons mordekaisers dragon didnt have a leash range and wasnt intended to have one mordekaiser could be bot lane while his dragon was mid except that for the first year of juggernaut mordekaisers existence  all the way up until we found the explanation  his dragon had no leash range with the basic skin and had one if he wore any other skin the dragon would blink back to him if hed go further than 2000 units away from him videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvw2zsy072gz4lt

ampnbsp

2 what happened when mordekaiser killed ekko after ulting him 

 a ekkos ghost ulted the blue teams fountain before warping back to where he died 

 b ekkos ghost had permanently increased range and each of his attacks made him dash to his target 

 c ekkos ghost spawned on the blue teams fountain and instantly died if mordekaiser was on the red team 

 d ekkos ultimate was replaced with mordekaisers for the remainder of the game 

correct answer gta ekkos ghost ulted the blue teams fountain before warping back to where he died  
dealing full damage and all counted as mordekaisers videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9ucnmbm65w4lt

ampnbsp

3 what happened when sylas attempted to use mordekaisers ultimate on a target entering a bush

 a the target immediately died and respawned without a death timer 

 b mordekaiser gained control of the resulting ghost instead of sylas 

 c sylas transformed into mordekaiser until his death 

 d sylas lost the ability to use his keystone until the end of the game 

correct answer gtc sylas transformed into mordekaiser until his death  
when ulting sylas takes the shape of the champion he uses the ult of during the cast but with mordekaisers ult if the spell got canceled by losing vision on the target he would just not transform back until his death thread with a video and everythinghttpswwwredditcomrmordekaisermainscommentsambxjiexplaining_the_sylas_transforming_intolt

ampnbsp

4 runes affecting shields have a history of not working correctly for mordekaiser by how much did revitalize increase his shield generation at most

 a 0

 b 165

 c 110

 d 1005

correct answer gtd 1005  
for years revitalize didnt work properly on mordekaisers shield generation gain 5 hsp heals and shields you cast or receive are 10 stronger on targets below 40 hp then someday it got fixed except that instead of increasing his shield by 5 and 10 it went on to increase it by 5  1000 heres what his passivehttpsprntsclkmaz0 and ehttpsprntsclkmgno looked like with itlt

ampnbsp

5 what happened when pulsefire ezreal killed an enemy affected by mordekaisers ultimate

 a no ghost was created 

 b a ghost was created but its basic attacks were permanently replaced with targeted mystic shots 

 c a ghost was created but it was permanently invisible and impossible to click on 

 d a ghost was created but it was permanently invisible and stuck in place 

correct answer gtc a ghost was created but it was permanently invisible and impossible to click on  
in most cases mordekaisers ghosts took the shape and most properties that the champion had upon dying a champion turning into a ghost while in an invisible state would in several cases make the ghost fully invisible and pulsefire ezreal disintegrates the enemies he kills videohttpsyoutubezfm4ot4cftgt590lt

ampnbsp

6 what could mordekaiser not do for his opponents 

 a give an enemy a heal of 1500 hitpoints with his w 

 b give the opposing team the baron buff 

 c give the enemies his location through fog of war 

 d give the other team bonus ap with his ultimate 

correct answer gtd give the other team bonus ap with his ultimate  
a an enemy braum could eat mordekaisers heal and take it for himself and that heal could go in the 1500range videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdcpoy2c3hsw  
b no video of that one but if youd attack baron with the ghost of a darius have the ghost die and then have baron die from the bleed itd be given to darius team and not to yours  
c mordekaisers w detonation could be heard through fog of war if youd put your camera over where an enemy mordekaiser was and hed use his w youd be able to hear it even without vision videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvptbk6fguzyelt

ampnbsp

7 a jhin ghost could have some advantages compared to the real jhin which one of these options could a jhin ghost not have

 a every attack firing the 4th shot 

 b 25 attack speed 

 c attack range permanently increased to 700 

 d critical hits dealing 200225 damage at all levels 

correct answer gtd critical hits dealing 200225 damage at all levels  
a probably mordekaisers most famous interaction  jhins ghost would never use ammunition and as such would remain on whatever bullet he died with so killing a jhin with his fourth shot ready would result in the ghost firing his fourth shot on every basic attack videohttpsyoutubex4oi_orobpit25  
b jhins ghost also had unlocked attack speed so he could reach upwards of 25 as videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlr4yzo0npi0  
c ghosts could gain energized charges but they couldnt trigger statikkrfcs empowered attacks that meant that they would never lose the charges and that rfcs increased range would apply to every attack once charged  
d that one is almost applicable too jhins crits deal reduced damage compared to other champions but for some reason a jhin ghost would only get that damage reduction after level 16  crits before that dealt full damage d ends up being the correct answer because of at all levels  
and heres a display of a fearsome jhin ghosthttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv_9f4lg9s6walt  

ampnbsp

8 what could happen when you activated the guardian angel of an opponent affected by mordekaisers ultimate

 a your ultimate was replaced with mordekaisers for the remainder of the game 

 b your abilities stopped functioning until the ghost died 

 c every player crashed and the game disappeared 

 d the opponents guardian angel was automatically sold the moment it was activated 

correct answer gta your ultimate was replaced with mordekaisers for the remainder of the game  
theres an explanation but just take the videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtatl2xjvmbqlt

ampnbsp

9 what could using protobelt cause for mordekaiser

 a make mordekaisers ghosts release the protobelt projectiles on every basic attack for the rest of the game 

 b make mordekaisers w invisible for the rest of the game 

 c prevent mordekaisers e from dealing damage 

 d disable the opponents press the attack keystone 

correct answer gtb make mordekaisers w invisible for the rest of the game  
using protobelt with w active would make the effects of the spell disappear from that point on for all players who had their screen on mordekaiser the moment he used the item on either team videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmfhwirwqvxklt

ampnbsp

10 what happened when mordekaiser used his ultimate to kill an enemy mordekaisers ghost

 a the champion killed gained the ability to create a dragon ghost 

 b the ghost refreshed and came back with full health and a full timer under the control of the enemy mordekaiser but lost its items 

 c mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed and until his next death his shield would fully refill whenever it got depleted 

 d mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed but with a permanent 100 attack speed and bonus movement speed 

correct answer gtd mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed but with a permanent 100 attack speed and bonus movement speed  
this was a bug that i found really late despite playing a lot of blind pick i guess you just never think of wasting your ult on a ghost i have no idea how that happened but the ghost of a ghost had some properties of a dragon ghost  mordekaisers ult icon was replaced with the one he got from controlling the dragon the ghost gained bonus movespeed towards morde like the dragons it had bonus attack speed and it didnt gain the bonus ad and hp that a champion ghost would get from mordekaisers stats this couldnt be chained  that ghost would not give a ghost from being ulted by mordekaiser videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlr4yzo0npi0lt

and thats a wrap

well im here to tell you that this is the biggest lie since they said that nexus blitz would make a return in 2022

think about it if riot released a skin that was linked to a state of emergency even if it was a skin youve wanted since the dawn of time would you buy it

of course you wouldnt riot releasing pool party ahri means that league of legends is dying for real this time another big influx of cash wouldnt be able to help them with any underlying issues going on pool party ahri is a sign of the end times

but riot knows this as they are the ones who fabricated the myths of pool party ahri for their own benefit they are the only ones who know of this one simple fact there is no pool party ahri 

they created the idea of pool party ahri as a way to signify to the player base that nothing is wrong at all times for all we know riot was completely bankrupt at the start of this year which caused all of the problems such as the cinematic we got but they had their biggest propaganda piece working overtime for them

riot claiming that league would have its biggest budget ever this year did not do anything to ease the worries of the player base but you know what did the lack of pool party ahri if riot was really in trouble they would have released it by now thought the player base this must just be an unlucky streak and things will go back to normal soon

and we all ate it up we will continue to eat it up riot could be 50 billion dollars in debt from settling workplace harassment lawsuits and pool party ahri would never see the light of day

"hi im jack j i work fulltime on ai in competitive gaming and so have access to a lot of solo queue data today i decided to write an article for one simple purpose

finding nrg palafoxs genius in his kr solo queue data

tomorrow 19th october 2023 the lcs champions nrg face the lpl 4th seed weibo gaming in the first round of the league of legends world championship

its far too easy to be an na doomist i mean given their record and all however sometimes all you need is a little hope today that hope has come in the form of an offhand comment by xiaohu the wiebo midlaner who described palafox his opposite number in nrg as powerful and seems like a genius

yes this was later more accurately translated to be closer to talented with potential but as i say today is all about spreading the hopium

now i wont be jumping immediately to and so nrg will probably win worlds instead im simply going to try and fuel the fire my fuel in this case is a st tonne of korean solo queue data alongside a desire to answer a very simple question what makes palafox a genius

before we get into the detail heres a quick explanation of the data

data preliminaries

 all data comes from korean solo queue
 a special thank you to trackingtheproshttpswwwtrackingtheproscom who provide me with the solo queue account names
 i am writing this on the 18th october the data on the site below refreshes regularly and so will therefore not match exactly
 statistics are calculated from the players last 50 games to be best reflective of their current elo
 all statistics are adjusted by the players champion pool they are therefore reflective of the player and how they perform above or below the average for their champions
 when quoting percentiles they are being compared to all master accounts not just other professional players
 killsdeaths in the last 10 seconds of a game fountain dives mostly are removed as to not punish regular forfun fountain diving therefore some games will not match exactly what is quoted in a players match history
 you can see all data here itero korean solo queue statisticshttpswwwiteroggprostatistics

now on with the question what makes palafox a genius

i have over 500 statistics to deal with but to start let us keep it simple he currently sits at a respectable 766lp from an impressive 441 games this puts him ahead of his lane opponent but admittedly hes had a few more games to get there

lp and games in kr solo queue 2023httpspreviewredditkbioqcd2dzub1pngwidth462ampformatpngampautowebpamps7b101d5dbc73ae1c2532b2f714d91815cd3e06b6

his champion pool is also by most comparisons fairly normal no sign of his genius just yet

palafoxs recent champion poolhttpspreviewredditcabxdf7bdzub1pngwidth773ampformatpngampautowebpamps31fc5403df56d8c13683200cc9fdea9e3156f5f3

having spent the last hour studying his solo queue data in an almost stalkerish level of detail there was one theme that stood out among all others

palafox is the kda king

 overall kdahttpspreviewredditi8ye5jfedzub1pngwidth462ampformatpngampautowebpamps55df5f6430152fb5acfda7159456689ca91b824f

remember all stats are adjusted by the champion pool his raw average is lower but he constantly overperforms on kda when compared to other high ranked players who play similar champions

there were several components that makeup his overall kda that stoodout to me

 kda against his lane opponent
 kda in the jungleriver and the impact on objective control
 kd in solo bolos

 kda against his lane opponent

kills  assists on midlanershttpspreviewredditauej9nihdzub1pngwidth497ampformatpngampautowebpamps61249e5ec9295fa803452b40f3af9272e6780d0e

lets start with his kills  assists against midlaners although hes in the bottom third of the elo since solo queue mavericks tend to play riskier than pros he remains competitive with more comparable opponents like g2 caps and xiaohu  faker being an outlier for his passiveness in lane

his genius however may best be seen when you use the above in conjunction with his deaths to midlaners

deaths to midlanershttpspreviewreddit090jpn5ldzub1pngwidth462ampformatpngampautowebpampsce29ff3f7663a7f73c2b3beda5e29093594882e0

xiaohu is killing midlaners at a rate of 33 a game but dying to them at the exact same rate whilst caps is even dying more than he kills them palafox manages to get 34 kills or assists a game on his fellow midlaners whilst only dying to them 23 times a master class in controlled aggression

kda in the jungle amp river

the second component is his kda specifically whilst inside the jungle and river usually these happen during team fights and skirmishes around key objectives like heralds and dragons

kda in the jungle  riverhttpspreviewreddit054bdd0odzub1pngwidth514ampformatpngampautowebpamps40776538c72759ba162891df05a5f565f57dc65c

for this one i use a slightly different statistic than normal rather than looking at a kda ratio i instead add up all his kills  assists in the jungle and take away his deaths

the conclusion is really selfexplanatory palafox seems to just be better than xiaohu at team fights in the jungle i really cant be budged on this conclusion sorry

you may also be wondering given his absolute dominance in jungle team fighting do his teams tend to secure more dragons and heralds

net dragons amp net baronshttpspreviewreddit6v0mohz0ezub1pngwidth796ampformatpngampautowebpampsebd0612340b191ecd96759c23e2fa47c7c8b2443

again i use a slightly different metric here rather than looking at the raw amount of monsters killed i look at the net value if your team takes it you get 1 if the enemy takes it you get 1 and if no one took it you get 0

data note i include dragonsheralds that the player did not directly assist with since there are plenty of ways of helping your team secure an objective without needing to be directly involved

with palafoxs exceptional jungle team fighting he is able to help his team secure dragons and heralds far above the average and certainly above xiaohu

solobolo kd differential

as our final statistic let us now look at how many solobolos he averages per game and how that compares to his solobolo deaths

solo bolos kdshttpspreviewreddit7hktw6k3ezub1pngwidth796ampformatpngampautowebpampsc1c3ae835a279ac1419b06be940a61af471b21c7

if you look closely at the table you can quite quickly see that nrg are going to beat weibo tomorrow at this point its a mathematical fact xiaohu is only managing 139 solo kills a game but is getting solo killed 127 times our boy palafox not only manages to get more solo kills 148 hes also doing it whilst being solo killed considerably less 081

to conclude

through my research and writing of this brief solo queue analysis i have become increasingly confident that nrg will be beating weibo tomorrow this will come almost exclusively through an absolute monstrous midgap which will unfold a little like this

 xiaohu in a desperate attempt to show his prowess will make a number of failed plays against palafox who will happily take the free kill or assist whilst safely farming his lane
 around the 810 minute mark both teams will collapse around herald where nrg will emerge victorious after an almost flawless team fight from their midlanerhuffs the last tin of copium
 although nrg are ahead at this point its not until a monstrous solo bolo from palafox onto xiaohu and the subsequent baron does the game become a complete onesided stomp followed by a 27minute final push

galio w  2545 damage reduction plus some ap and mr scaling for magical damage and half of that for physical damage gets to move but slower has a taunt and can be interrupted

"ive been playing league for about 13 years now starting in the middle of 2010 i reached diamond i in 2014 when there was only like 400 spots on challenger and the rest was d1 playing as a jungler and i gotta say this game is making me very sad

riot is changing the jungle in ways i cannot fathom lowering the skill cap and destroying a lot of techniques and strategies from the role and my theory is that they are doing this because no one wants to play jungle anymore bear with me for a second

i started playing back recently and while grinding back to the high elo what i saw was just so sad the players always had a way of blaming the jungler for everything and i guess there are plenty of bad junglers out there but as a former semiprofessional grinding through low elo i was astonished to see the sheer amount of rage and toxicity my team gave me despite them being like gold or plat and understanding nothing of jungle everygame you have to mute your entire team or get raged all day

in this scenario every day more junglers stop playing it was easy to notice that support was the least picked role everytime someone would get autofilled in this role but slowly the game started to change and the autofilled role became jungle

so why is riot trying to do with these changes is to reduce the gap between a true jungler and a autofill or make the game just easier in case both junglers are autofill so that they dont die 15 time to jungle monsters

i understand saying that a role requires too much knowledge and trying to change the groundlevel for it but lowering a skill celling in a competitive game is just sad is saying that you dont want people to invest time knowing or studying your game you just want them to be able to do anything without any effortits like removing the ability of a champion attacking after walking because some adcs know how to kite too well and others dont

in these recent movements ive seen most of my jungler friends stop playing and i criticized them but now its my turn i feel like most junglers will drop jungle after this but a lot of players from other roles might get interested so well have to build the jungle role player pool from scratch

is this what riot wants how do nonjunglers feel about this i dont know and would love to hear your opinions but for me this game is done

riot might as well get rid of the jungle position and turn it into dota 2 i guarantee that with no junglers laners just stop crying and play their game i feel this is the only solution since people wont change  


____________________________________________________________________________

edit

ok so correcting a few things

 sorry for all the laners that felt attacked its obvious that its this dynamic that brought this problem of junglers x team and this doesnt help
 im not complaining about the latest patch im complaining about all the changes riot has made on the latest months that made the game as a jungler so boring to quote one of the comments that summarizes it well

1 reintroduction of catchup xp fixing peoples bad pathing
2 invade nerfs making it harder to punish bad pathing
3 range and leash changes making it harder to kite camps and impossible to multi camp
4 removed smite heal from camps because too much skill expression no it was not to nerf overall jg healing they moved it into camp kills so you couldnt smite in combat for hp also changed from old redblue smite which had different active effects to the current system where the smite summoner spell is the same and the difference is all passive effects so you dont need to think as hard about smite usage
5 crab spawns later allowing every jg to 6 camp into crab also crab nerfed so they are not punished for getting double crabbed
6 jg item changes so every jg clears basically same speed now in fact tank jgs now clear faster together with invade nerf means basically you never are incentivized to try and interact with enemy jg

i havent played ranked in about 2 years and i was in gold i came back to league a few months ago and just want to learn some new champs in normal but every game there are about 3 emerald players on the enemy team and if not theyre on my team instead and its just them carrying the game its so boring i just want to have fun and not be smurfed on im sure ranked is probably easier than normals these days,Bad Teammates
"ive had this happen to me at least 5 times this week where i pick my champion i see my matchup and i start editing my runes and then when i try to save or exit the editor runes could not be saved shows up and it defaults you to your first recommended rune page and the game launches

its not predictable and it ruins the game

without certain runes vs some matchups the lane is not playable at all and losing to game client instead of my teammates or opponents is just adding salt to the wounds of soloq

according to golgghttpsgolgg 369 currently has 356 career wins this means that he needs 13 more wins to reach his name 

right now jdg has to go through the swiss stage and the knockout stage to win worlds in order to get through the swiss stage you need 4 wins and for the knockout stage you need 9 totaling to 13 wins the only scenario where it doesnt add up is if jdg gets a 12 score in any of the bo3s in swiss

"in the past few weeks me and a few friends been dabbling into some other games and came into our attention on why games like league wild rift and dota 2 have features like

 maprift customization
 better player profile customization
 custom announcer packs

but pc league has a lackluster version of these or not even even that   


wild rift that is made by riot has really cool looking animated and interactive champion 3d models that you can examine but this is non existent on pc league dota 2 customization of your game is miles ahead of league with custom vo for announcers rn during the international they have several announcer packs from casters and community members from different regions to purchase map skins ui skins custom profile layouts and so on and the amount of stats data that you can access in dota 2 is immense in comparison  


im aware that league has way more pressing issues with its serviceclient that need to be addressed first for example its been almost 800 days and the br server still has account transfers blocked but my question is   


with the large amount of funding that riot has enough to fund multiple games wild rift legends of runeterra tft league stories games project l league mmo etc hollywood level production of shows arcane arcane season 2 musical productions with several famous artists lil nas x new jeans twice gidle imagine dragons etc then why when it comes to its main core game they seem to not add new features its taken multiple years for them to allow us to choose a different language of the client in league this is coming in november qol and customization stuff that riot themselves implemented to its other games under the same ip

"just something to read before worlds 2023 swiss stage starts sourcehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfen_ihkqdpa 

nofe was a former league coach and is currently an lck caster this is a quick review of the 2023 worlds playins meta alongside a prediction of how the meta will shift during the swiss stage

ampx200b

translation

as always im going to focus on drafts and meta instead of hyperfocusing on individual teams so my goal is to guess the swiss stage meta by taking a look at what worked well in playins  

if you look at how metas shifted during various stages of previous worlds there is a very obvious trend  obviously playin teams have a much lower level of play  and this is reflected in their drafts these teams tend to draft with a focus on teamfights in the later stages of the tournament the stronger teams are much more lane focused and this isnt just a matter of preference in the playin stage teamfightfocused comps tend to have a much higher winrate  

this pattern held in this years playins despite all the speculation about how the worlds patch would play out¬†the playin stage meta was all about teamfighting that being said the meta will probably change drastically once the swiss stage begins just like how previous metas shifted drastically during the group stage the best asian teams are very good at snowballing off of lane advantages which is the reason why lower tier teams have such a hard time pulling off upsets anyways the swiss stage meta will probably be completely different from the playin stage meta and my predictions are attempting to account for that 

ampx200b

top 

 keeping that in mind lets take a look at which champions had priority during playins starting with top there were 2 picks that stood out  ksante and renekton renektons mr nerfs compounded with the statikk shiv nerfs made it look like split pushers like gp gnar and gwen would dominate the meta but these champions didnt manage to make it onto the stage defying expectations ksante and renekton held strong when teams were forced to blind pick top most teams chose to pick renekton these teamfight powerhouses were popular especially among weaker teams interestingly ksante fared very well in the head to head against renekton renektons greatest strengths are his lane priority into his strong herald fights but ksante neutralized these advantages very well rumble and kennen were also strong picks into renekton especially when paired with jayce mid i believe this ap top  jayce mid pattern will carry on into the swiss stage if you look at the results ksante did much better than renekton renekton was much weaker than previous patches especially against ap tops oh and adams gods were definitely interesting to watch im not sure how well these picks will work out in the swiss stage against the strong asian top laners they all play mean gnars and theres also a slight chance that some asian tops will counter with fiora reminiscent of former worlds since this is a meta where junglers actually go top it will be interesting to see how the asian teams interpret gods 

so what do i expect to see during the swiss stage to begin with i predict a lot of kennens and gnars and maybe gangplank depending on the player i dont want to get too deep into this since itll take a long time to explain but the top pool depends on the mid pool with the popularity of syndra and orianna standing mages that have a hard time side laning top lane champions with strong side laning abilites will naturally become much better champions like jax these champions and their lane counters will become much more prominent in the swiss stage

ampx200b

jg 

 moving on to jungle if you look at solo queue statistics lee sin nidalee and jarvan look very powerful but so far this trend didnt make its way into pro play maokai dominated of course theres a chance that this is due to the fact that playin teams prefer teamfighting champs taliyah was also a high priority pick i thought about the jg picks for a very long time and ive arrived at a conclusion which jungles will be meta im sorry to say this but i expect maokai and sejuani to be the most contested jungles syndra orianna and azir are going to me the mid meta champs  no question about that these champions need a strong dependable frontline will top play this role no jax and gnar are going to be splitpushing which leads to the natural conclusion  were going to see tank jungles like sejuani and maokai i expect lots of maokai sejuani jarvan and vi maybe nocturne to aid the splitpushing top or even some viegos in other words the champs weve seen all summer with the addition of jarvan with lee sin im not sure despite currently performing well in solo queue and scrims lee generally tends to do poorly on stage some lck teams like t1 and dk who love snowballing might take the risk and lpl teams like blg might try as well lee sin works well with sylas galio and lissandra which are all champions that yagao excels at 

 oh and slightly unrelated but there has to be an lck or lpl team that plays taliyah all the time in scrims the playin teams drafted heavily around taliyah especially bds teams seem to place rate taliyah very highly which personally didnt make much sense looking in from the outside taliyah does have swap value though so some lck and lpl teams might bust her out on stage  

ampx200b

mid 

 next on to mid despite all of the nerfs azir is still a strong meta pick with a strong skill set good late game value and playmaking ability azir simply refuses to leave the pro meta the skill set is one that pro players refuse to give up azir is just too good at parrying kill threats from champs like rakan and jarvan and azirs late game value is strong too melting tanks and poking the champion is too perfect yone and akali match well into azir though so expect to see a few of those the asian mids are all great at yone and akali their mere existence prevents blind pick azir which i expect to limit azirs impact on the meta post swiss stage  

 this patch orianna and syndra are insane¬†if you look at the data both champs have high presence and syndras win rate is off the charts since stronger teams tend to put higher priority on laning these champions will become even more important as time progresses expect to see more of these two not less i expect that all of you know about showmakers syndra or fakers infamous orianna shockwave no matter who you look at be it bdd knight yagao etc all of the koreanchinese mid laners are extremely proficient at playing orianna and syndra not a single player is bad on these champs  maybe xiaohu but even xiaohu was once famous for his mid mages there are no weak players neeko is also a strong playmaking pick alongside adcs like kaisa and i expect to see some neekos but her laning is not quite as strong as it once was it really depends on the team and the players sylasakaliyone will be utilized by teams focused on midgame especially teams that prefer strong mid carries like gen g and dk there is a good chance that we see these champs sylas may have a hard time laning against ap mid mages but he does have an advantage against team comps with powerful ults maokai sejuani gnar and gp all have strong ults furthering the case for sylas last but not least leblanc could see some minor play paired with lee sin all in all the mid meta is interesting because there are so many champions that could see fringe play even galio and lissandra could see some play tristana and annie are not as strong anymore i would prefer jayce over tristana

ampx200b

bot 

when you build a team comp the choice of adc is the most important thing to consider the entire team composition is warped around the choice of adc in that sense there are 2 champions that have very distinct flavors  xayah and kaisa if your team has xayah the goal is to make the other team come into you you want 2 things  a sturdy front line and¬†long range¬†xayah comps go hand in hand with mid mages and with long range mids azir jayce tristana force the enemy to engage and let xayah clean up 

kaisa is the polar opposite of xayah the entire teamfight revolves around how well you can focus fire a single priority target when kaisa ults in kaisa loves champions like yone ahri and neeko not that kaisa cant be used with say orianna but if you want to make the most use out of kaisas dps you need to draft a dive comp 

 ezreal aphelios and zeri made their mark during playins looking at solo queue data the best adcs were champs like ezreal ashe kalista and jhin all supportive adcs without a single hypercarry the adc carry meta was nonexistant but in playins the meta did a 180 and shifted towards hypercarry adcs but its impossible to tell how the meta will shift during the swiss stage lck and lpl teams can take a bot lane advantage and snowball the entire game off of that so we could see a lot of ezreal karma kalista   caitlyn   etc if teams can manage to annihilate kaisas and xayahs during the laning phase the adc tier list can change drastically so its really hard to predict what will be strong until we actualy see what happens on stage and since adcs are the backbone of team comps drafts will be completely different depending on what ends up on top 

 if it turns out that supportive adcs like ashe and jhin are dominant then teams will start playing around mid game comps in this case theyre going to have to find late game value somewhere else  which will probably result in a surge in popularity of powerful splitpushing top laners so the top meta depends on the adc tier list itll be fun to see what ends up on top no one knows whats going to be good but if theres one thing im certain of its that utility supports are really really weak compared to previous seasons so well be seeing lots nautilus rakan and rell this points towards kalista being strong and ezrealcaitlyn being weak but its hard to tell sivir isnt bad and teams with skilled support players might play senna since senna funnels gold into supports but i think that kalista will be the staple meta adc if initiation supports are meta then kalista will be used to both compliment them and to have a strong laning phase kalista is good at transfering bot lane dominace into the upper half of the map and she pairs off with mid mages very well and people have this perception that kalista is complete crap late game but shes stronger than youd think even though she doesnt compare to actual hypercarry adcs 

i could be totally wrong and the meta could shift to something i couldnt have dreamed of in a million years just take this as my personal take the meta will change from swiss to knock out to finals so its really impossible to tell at this point to summarize my personal opinion  

ampx200b

summary 

predictions before playins supportive adcs like ashe and jhin will be meta top amp jg will play carry picks mid mages will be strong 

ampx200b

the playin meta adc hypercarry meta and junglers mostly played tanks mid mages were strong  

ampx200b

swiss stage predictions we will have a top amp jungle carry meta with a few¬†adc hypercarry comps sprinkled in depending on the team teams will try to snowball through bot and roll the snowball up to top and in the process the high priority champions will be strong side laners like gnar gwen jax and bot snowball champs like kalista some adcs might play hypercarry adcs like xayah and kaisa azir syndra and orianna will be strong picks in the midlane

"in his most recent videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvspxs6ufs3kk phreak explained his rationale behind the seraphine changes and why theyre not a death knell for seraphine mains ive transcribed some of the video and emphasized some key lines

 disparity between roles
3818 
gt mid and support winrates are 01 apartthey are the exact same power level and despite having the exact same power level support seraphine pickrate is sixteen times midlane seraphine pickrate  

gt we cant really in good conscience buff a  53 winrate champion whos got a respectable pickrate especially in high elo where players optimize for winrate and thus pick a really really high winrate ap champion i think bot lane carry seraphine can be 51 52 thats fine

 4025 
gt we decided to say okay lets bring botlane seraphine whos way up hereand support seraphine is down here and lets bring their power levels together lets have bot seraphine and support seraphine have roughly the same power level that would be nice and as a side goal if we can make seraph midlaner better thats nice but its also so incredibly unpopular it has less that half the pickrate of jungle teemo for exampleits pickrate is nearidentical to that of zyra jungle and zyra jungle is a 46 winrate jungler

gt theres just not that much of a market for seraphine mid and so in terms of serving the sixteen times the number of players who clearly want to play seraphine support and the 116th that number of players who dont play seraphine mid we say were going to serve the sixteen times more players and we have to compensate botlane

5535 
gt its also worth noting that the entire suite of changes is midlane skewed if this is in sum total neutral on winrate this is a midlaneskewed buff and a botlane apcskewed nerf
gt  if less of her power is in the absolutely absurd levels of healing from her w this means more of her power is in her solo lane selfreliant power budget such as my shield is strongerhas a lower cooldown and my q does more damage on a lower cooldown so the w changes are midlane skewed or rather a nerf to everything but midlane now of course teamfight output is of course weaker to be fair w2 is very clearly the best spell to echo its not even close this skill is so overpowered this is where basically all her power is

gt our internal read on winrate magnitude is that this overall set of changes that were still going through is about 05 winrate positive to botlane seraphine and about 3 winrate positive to support seraphine im a little skeptical because i think the w nerf is very very very very large and im kind of relying on it to eat the entire power budget of everything else going on in this changelist because everything else is powerpositive and its like okay this is the only line of a real nerf in the kit

 10040 
gt whats the overall result going to be for this champion its hard to say i think very strongly that support seraphine is going to be quite a bit better i think bot seraphine will roughly tread water i actually have reason to believe that mid seraphine will gain winrate right here i think she will gain less than support seraphine gains because the q is so aggressively skewed towards support builds and not as aggressively good for ap builds but there is definitely a chance that seraphine is just busted next patch and of course there also is the chance to get the numbers wrong and she sucks and if she sucks we buff the champion but the primary goal is to basically lower the gap between bot seraphine and support seraphine because were not allowed to buff seraphine in any role because bot seraphine is too op so we play up her level scaling we play down her gold scaling we play up her enchanter tendencies we play down a little bit her group tendencies and maybe we get to close the gap between botlane and mid and support and that would be great because ti would be great to have her viable at all three roles  
gt its been a pipe dream so far weve always been constrained by mid seraphine being op and support seraphine sucked and then bot seraphines op and support seraphine sucked and now it would be nice if we got all three im not holding my breath but thats the goal

 q changes

 4711 
gt q is getting a shorter cooldown ranks one through four it is getting more base damage ranks two through five and a better ap ratio at rank one the same ap ratio at rank two and a worse ratio rank three four and five now remember what i said earlier about games ending on average with enough gold for three items  
master seraphine gets 65 less gold across their game than silver seraphine botlane which is to say its much more likely that low elo seraphine actually finishes three items than masters seraphine finishes three items  
the rational thought is that q is strictly stronger at rank one strictly stronger at rank two strictly stronger at rank three strictly stronger at rank four and then stronger at rank five from minutes nine through twentyseven until you finish seraphs embrace do not let anyone tell you the seraphine changes are a nerf because they are not they pretty much cant be there is a part of time where the spell is weaker that is paid for by the first 25 minutes being stronger and that means that by her being stronger at winning 1v1s and getting lane priority and winning teamfights and securing objectives and killing turrets pays for more ability power to further offset where she would be weaker in a real game the acute changes are a strict buff to seraphine  
q is strictly buffed it is more buffed for support than for a farm lane but it is overall buffed for the champion no ifs ands or buts q change is a strict buff to seraphine if this was the only change she would gain winrate in every single role she plays do not let anyone tell you otherwise theyre wrong

 w changes

5314 
gt by having the shield go up per rank and the cooldown go down per rank and though the rank one ability mana cost goes up the mana cost per rank goes down there are three levers here that all say maxing w is better than it was before its worth noting that again because support seraphine does not get a lot of ability power maxing q is also better than before so well see which way they go but it is going to be a lot of power to support seraphine in both of those cases 
gt im believing pretty strongly we should never get anywhere close to sonas level of cooldown spamming w on a short cooldown feels more like sonas sort of thing and so leaving this a as a relatively long cooldown because it does shield your entire team and can be doublecasted for minimum 300 shield to your team before ap ratiothats a lot of power thats a way shorter cooldown and actually more shielding than karma e so we have to be pretty respectful here this can get way too powerful way too fast
gt the final change to w as compensation is a pretty significant nerf to the heal of a repeatcast w so not only is the base heal going down by 2 missing health at all ranks but also the ap ratio is going away entirely there is no longer an ap ratio on the w

 e changes

 5916 
gt the e changes are strictly midlane buffs e cost per rank goes down from ten per rank to five per rank and the e damage is  a meaningful damage increase at max rank 60 max rank so its fifteen damage per rank up so if you get to that lategame mid seraphine scenario where you finally have more ability power you finally finish the third item even though the game ended the moment you finish the third item congratulations e does more damage now and makes up for your damage in front of q so again shes just a stronger mage than before the upto60 extra damage on e of course that is very late in the game and often not reached but even the 15 at level 14 is easily reached  this is basically a freebie midlane lever to say hey her level scaling is probably going to be a bit better now its much harder for bot and support seraphine to get the later levels",Champion Design

a little background on my situation im a multiaccount master tier adc main looking to give something back to the community that i grew up with through solo queue coaching ive tutored both in college and high school but outside of that i have no coaching experience in league or anywhere else i sometimes review vods of my friendsmutuals to help others improve and overall i have a very strong sense of macro knowledge in my particular role i found that there are very few adc educational content creators coaches and resources compared to other roles so i figure the market is open to adc coaches at the moment

i am looking at the first page of google for coaching services and applying to each one i am qualified for however i am a bit stuck on what exactly i should be doing to get prepared so far ive
watched countless challenger adc coaching videos on yt
began setting up a coachify profile

"just think about it we have been spoiled before

its 2019 there are 3 competitive regions on the world stage wild cards and na the community is split on who to call the favorites g2 won msi fnatic had two 5 game series against them invictus gaming are the reigning champions fpx beat them to win lpl t1 looks scary when they won lck while the raw potential of dwg and griffin makes them a contender

nobody shouldve had any doubts who would win after the worlds song was realeased however fly fly phoenix fly fpx  funplus phoenix  was revealed as the champions by riot before the tournament even began its time for a new empire china were to become the new overlords as demanded by sun emperor tencent

why does it matter riot released the worlds song gods some of you will say well actually that would just mean team whales vs t1 in the finals so artemis can face off against zeus duh and it would be an obvious conclusion but team whales are out its not happening

we were given the key by the casters over and over again to decypher the message they keep talking about adams champion pool especially his garen olaf darius and sett gods

but there is more while the song is called gods there is a line that reveals the whole truth once you play god once play god they gonna crumble one by one the s is missing garen olaf darius and sett have a 100 win rate currently when played by adam sett however will turn out to be a false prophet that adam has to forsake to bring victory to his team 

the plot armor is too strong the home crowd loves it and you can make a great skin line out of it there is no way bds loses god will lead them to victory

so a few weeks ago there was some complaints that belveth had insane soloq banrate due to how broken she it was and riots response was that they wanted to see her at worlds after worlds patch she was insta nerfed ive checked the stats and turns out she was only pickban once at worlds qualifier gg vs bds by gg river at game 2 which he lost so 100 lose rate no team so far has bothered to look at her why do the weaker teams simply fail to see her potential and she will start being picked at the main event now by the stronger teams does she simply not fit into the meta",Bad Teammates
"look i wont lie to myself the honor level 5 rewords are hot booty cheeks but all you have to do is play the game and not call people slurs is it really that hard to just competitive bs and say damn youre playing master yi clearly youre ass at the game or something along those nature  


i know league is probably one of the most toxic communities out there but as someone who competitive bss a lot honor level 5 is not that hard to get infact i think its the easiest part about this game   


ive been playing this game for about 3 years now and usually get honor level 5 within a few months of the reset because i dont understand peoples desire to tell everyone to keep themselves safe or call them racial or derogatory slurs its a video game 

what prompted me to ask this is because my friend recently just posted in my discord that he managed to reach honor level 0 and while i would be surprised i know the man and im not surprised but ive seen people here and twitter saying getting honor level 5 is too hard for what its worth i promise you its not unless theres some secret about honor level i dont know about thats holding people back

"lets be honest the old banner of command was toxic i too remember that meta where you got baron and put an ivern bush on the minion while it four shot towers that said i think from an enjoyment standpoint that was a better place for the usage of a splitpushing item that also had usage  when playing with the team we know that that iteration of the split push item has since went the way of the dodo due to balancing issues which was of course reasonable what is interesting to note here is that i feel hullbreaker serves the role of a splitpusher item even worse at the end of the end hullbreaker is the single largest stat stick riot has ever made to the point where it becoming a staple item on champions that want to teamfight eg yas yone and even 4th on samira this not only is the least interactive way to make a champion strong is the sidelane its not even at the expense of teamfighting power since the core stats are so insane anyways at the end of the day hullbreaker as has managed to do a poorer job at being a splitpushers item then its previous iterations and i think that thats a damn shame i think at this point the item archetype is here to stay so what do you think could be done to make a splitpushing item that feels less oppressive and more skill expressive

  
note though i do fully agree with the above post it is the sole result of losing a game to a tryndamere ",Bad Teammates
"for people who dont know banner of command was an item you bought to promote a minion to take  reduced damage from enemy champions and turrets and granted it bonus stats on a 2 minute cooldown it also gave all the gold killed by the minion to its owner

it gave 125 base health regen 60 armor and 30 mr and cost 2200 gold  riot removed banner of command because well the item influenced a terrible meta where people bought it just for pushing and would make a team to protect the cannon minion from getting killed either by poking away the enemy team or making sure they couldnt walk up to do anything at all about the minion

ampx200b

introducing hullbreaker this item gives while no allied champs are nearby 2060 armor and magic resistance depending on level which is amazing stats and you deal 20 more damage to towers not even adding to the fact that you indirectly buff your large minion it can be a super minion 60180 armormagic resistance and it deals 200 increased damage to towers

not even accounting for the rest of the stats it gives the champion which include  300 hp 150 base health regen 60 ad and a 5 movement speed buff

this item is literally a buffed banner of command because it can be built on any champion who has the mobility to get away or 1v1 or even 2v1 with the item and completely shifts the game state over to who has the best hullbreaker champ or who has a hullbreaker champ

how did riot even think this item is balanced in any way just considering a soloq standpoint where you have 0 communication the item has overbuffed stats and if your team cant match the push or somehow end the game before the top laner gets the item it will be a nuisance all game until you somehow win or more than likely lose

there was a reason banner of command was taken out of the game and that was because it was a toxic item that forced teams into either having it or somehow countering it which with the introduction of hullbreaker seems even easier than actually stopping a hullbreaker champ",Bad Teammates
"it seems as though the new meta is aptanks with ad junglers being unusually weak with the exception of graves and briar of note hecarim and belveth are both really weak at the moment

a new meta seems to be forming within some ad junglers where they will do a 3 camp or 4 camp clear into an early base in order to purchase a dorans blade this is in order to be stronger around the 3 minute mark 3 camp version of this may require taking futures market

clearing the jungle across the board seems much slower and junglers seem like theyre being pushed to lower income more supportive role if pros played on this patch i think maokai would be even more prioritized than he is at worlds

junglers  how do you feel right now

laners  do you noticed junglers ganking less or being weaker overall throughout the game

"hi all

so im writing this in the hopes riot will consider implementing so additional information regarding how effective items are currently most items show how much additional healing shielding damage etc they are giving and in some cases spirit visage eclipse divine sunderer we can see multiple types of benefits

currently there are a few missing that i think would be good to see most notably the new adc mythics are all lacking information as to their additional damage output

infinity edge additional crit damage

navori quickblades additional crit damage and cd reduction

bloodthirster additional damage and healing done

collector number of executes and gold

lord dominics additional damage through  pen 

voidstaff through additional pen

rylais crystal scepter time slowed sec

cosmic drive movement speed active sec

riftmaker healing done

shieldbow healing done

blade of the ruined king healing done

ravenous hydra healing done

mortal reminder damage from  pen

guinsoos rageblade on hit damage done additional on hit damage done for other items producing off this and additional damage done from pen

seryldas grudge additional damage from pen and time slowed sec

divine sunderer additional damage from pen

plated steel caps damage reduced from auto attacks

eclipse additional damage from pen

runaans hurricane additional damage from on hit damage and additional damage from on hit damage from other items

i feel adding these would give players a lot more clarity on what their items are actually doing ingame as the many already showing these details do

i would also suggest adding additional damage from flat pen items like sorcerer boots and lethality items

im interested if others would like to see this information let me know your thoughts

"from a statistical stand point we can clearly see that winning game 2 is better than winning game 1

in 100 of the series so far has the team that won game 2 won the series

where as there only is an 80 win rate for the team winning game 1

team whales is the only team so far that has deliberately aimed for spiking in game 2 and its paying off even winning against for fun potential worlds winners bds with this strategy

in their series we could see bds spiked their performance in game 1 and then started falling off while the welsh lads was bing chilling in game 1 and started playing in game  2

we saw them utilise the same strategy against cfo and it worked

ampx200b

obviously seeing a strategy like this might raise some question marks for one when the orcas are getting into the swiss stage the first couple of rounds are gonna be in a bo1 format where dropping the first game for good measure because it  frankly doesnt matter might not be the best strategy as the game 2 doesnt exist

but once they get into the lower bracket bo3s again we will see the same strategy flourish

so do you think other teams have been looking at this amazing strategy and is going to try and use it themselves do you think gam has been picking up on this or will gam just be another 31 walkover bing chilling game 1 from the most innovative team at worlds",Bad Teammates

"im sure most people have seen it by now from the countless clips uploaded to highlight channels but jinx is blatantly overpowered right now from the buffs this patch that allow her to chain her passive where she gets more than 10 as and allow you to instantly finish the game if youre close to the enemy nexus shes currently 51 winrate with a 25 pickrate that rivals kaisa riot nerfed sett before for the same reason that occasionally he built the mathematically correct sett build allowing you to os people with his w this is the same situation

caitlyn is in the same boat  dont judge her winrate by the crit build but if you switch to lethality build her winrate shoots up to 57 with a very significant amount of matches she essentially stacks lethality becoming a menace as a lanebully and when she hits 3 items she becomes an ult bot which combined with first strike and axiom arc allows her to snowball gold just by pressing one button her ultimate can literally one shot any nontank in the game i dont think thats okay and it makes for a pretty boring playstyle in the botlane

here you have a few examples

1 illaoi top ganked 2 times by enemy jungler so she decided that we dont deserve a win when our jungler went top she just stood and watched angry how our diana died alone didnt participate in any teamfight 33 minutes wasted
2 katarina after 43 games had avg 145 but in my game did 04 and decided to troll for the rest of the game 27 minutes wasted
3 vayne did 232 in my game so ez win but suddenly decided to troll running in the jungle for the rest of the game and let enemies to destroy entire base 44 minutes wasted
4 countless supports who decide to flame their adc for the rest of the game for doing 02 instead of trully supporting them 150 games wasted

these are only 4 examples but i experience it every day  
these people are so mentally unstable and act like snowflakes that one ks or enemy gank can decide that all you can do is ff but this is often not an option because they hold you hostage

to keep the purists happy they could leave the base map still and make the drake maps more drastic and should include the deep water

i have a game mode idea most likely would be for an anniversary event in the future maybe the 20th anniversary just throwing that out there a game mode where not only you could select all the current champions in league of legends but all of the old versions of the champions as well i know some  have been minireworked 3000 times zeri im looking at you but maybe to keep it simple the on release versions of any champion that was considered a full rework i wont count beta for this since that is considered a testing stage so season 1 and onward any champion that had a previous version  imagine going top lane its urgot of today versus the urgot of the past even if the event only lasted a month i think it would be cool to let players experience these old versions of champions to make the game mode even crazier they bring back all the old rifttwisted treelinecrystal scar items that were removed maybe thats too far but this idea is already too far in my own eyes but i wanted to share it anyways

"intro  
hey guys  my company has been working on a fantasy app which is a little unique to traditional fantasy sports  it is 100 free to play there is no option to even take your money and is currently being tested and used for fun  i just today set it up to work with worlds and created a few public rooms that i hope people are interested in participating in  if the public rooms fill up  i will create more or you can create your own private rooms and invite your friends  


how to play  
simply navigate to auctionmadnesscomhttpsauctionmadnesscom and sign up with your gmail or email account  once in you will see that you can choose to create a group for you and your friends or join a public room and play with others  for worlds group sizes are limited to 4 people  in auction madness theres a set time that you have a live auction for all 16 teams remaining in the tournament  all 4 managers are given 100 in play money to bid on the 16 teams  important each manager will end with exactly 4 teams meaning if you are the highest bidder on the first 4 teams you cannot bid any more for the rest of the auction so manage your budget accordingly  


the auction  
the auction is a live event and has a designated start time  the auction will start even if you are not there so make sure youre there on time to be able to participate  auctions for this event should take about 15 minutes  in it a team is selected at random to be bid on and when the time expires or everyone else has passed the team is awarded to the leading bidder  if all managers pass or no bids are placed the team is put in the back of the line and a new team is selected  


scoring  
in auction madness points are denoted with a dollar sign  even though there is no money at risk or in play  it is a free website  if you choose to set up a separate private room you can adjust scoring but for our public rooms the scoring works as follows  
 all swiss games are worth 6 points each bo3s are treated as one game  
 all 8 teams that make it to the ko stage earn an additional 7 points  
 the 4 teams that win the quarterfinals earn  an additional 15 points  
 the 2 teams that win the semifinals earn an additional 24 points  
 the worlds winner will earn an additional 38 points  


for example a team that goes 23 in swiss and is eliminated will earn 12 points  


a team that goes 31 in swiss and is eliminated in the semifinals earns 40 points broken down as  
 6 points per swiss win  18 points  
 7 points for making it to the ko stage for a total of 25 points  
 15 points for winning in the quarterfinals for grand total of 40 points  


im very excited to share this with you all and really hope you enjoy it  ive joined one of our public rooms if youd like to join my group follow this invite link

like the title says what is a popular champion that you see getting picked all the time and discussed a lot that you simply dont like to use for me itd have to be darius every time this champion is brought up everyone talks about how braindead and easy but at the same time fun and satisfying he is i tried him so many times wondering what im missing from him but i just dont get it i cant bring myself to liking him so whats yours,Bad Teammates
"so i was arguing with a friend about wether or not lng vs fnc will be a close game or not we both think lng will win he just says it will be close and the conversation turned into him saying that the gap between the lpl and the lec is smaller than the gap between lec and lcs
am i the only one that thinks this is a really bad take  the only team i can think of that will put up a fight against any of the top 3 lpl teams is g2 and still i think they will loose
what do you guys think am i right or am i underrating the lec and fnatic",Bad Teammates
"my conclusion the comunity of this game is by far the worst i have ever seen  
and im not talking about toxic people  
 everyone being passively agresive towards eachother all the time no mater what  
 surrendering games with a 2k gold defecit and even objectives a lot  
 im talking about giving up on the game because people are going even in lane and just runing it down  
before you say oh this is only in x low elo  
i played on both my accounts one is a d4 acc the other is a lvl 36 acc i used at some point long time ago tought id have a look at how a freshish acc looked like  
by far the low lvl acc was the least bad altho skill dif is quite obvious most of the time  
both ranked and unraked i saw these cases the random ff slightly les in ranked since there are 25 that are still trying to play the game a lot of the time  
i will not be returning dispite my friends  constantly naging me to play league with them  
the community is just in such a bad state it used to be lots of trolling and joking around back in the day season 12 but right now its just constant depresion and passive agresive sour people everywhere",Bad Teammates
"this is a crazy stat to me korea is the best league country by far its not even close even on the winning lpl teams half the players and arguably the best are korean themselves

"earlier today dplus kia released a 30 min video on their youtube page httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo1aj5bccvcihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo1aj5bccvci with pretty lengthy interviews  video clips with each player i think en translations are delayed until next week but here are some highlights

430  dk players submitting worlds pickem

 canyon who will get the most penta kills who did you guys pick
 showmaker i picked deft we have to give him a penta deft never got a penta in his entire lck or worlds career
 deft wow if i get a penta at worlds
 canyon but i picked ruler
 showmaker ah sh to deft he said he picked ruler really we could even run into jdg
 deft ok well im voting for kanavi now

540  question is did you ever think there was a chance you would not qualify for worlds

 deft when summer split ended we were in a really worrying situation but playoffs scrims went really well so after that i felt like we would make worlds 100
 kellin yeah we overcame a lot of issues during playoffs and now worlds scrims are also going super well
 deft i feel like we got a lot closer during in game comms later in the season irl we were always pretty friendly from the start but it took some time to get that same closeness in game for example if a teammate makes a mistake they arent so worried now about how other teammates might react in game

825  excerpts of in game comms during scrims

 kellin canna dont worry bot lane is over were good
 showmaker canna if you can just group and be a warm body we can win
 canna im not sure if i can even do that lol
 showmaker yes you can lol our top wave state does make me want to quit the game though
 i think eventually enemy team ffed the scrim

1818  question is how is the team spirit now

 showmaker after regional finals the team morale has been really good i would say worlds is a really fun experience  compared to lck theres a lot more nerves and a lot more at stake weve all been to worlds before and in order to reproduce for canyondeftsm that amazing feeling when you win worlds everyone is giving extra effort and i think thats contributing to the team spirit
 canna i think our team synergy has improved a lot like were better at matching each others picks and creating a cohesive team comp now
 canyon weve been playing together for like 8 months now so i think our teamwork is really good at this point
 deft i also feel like our drafts are a lot cleaner now than they were in early season

2136 

 interviewer so worlds is the last time the 5 of you will be playing together
 showmaker ye but we could still play together next year the last time well its true ive been at dk for my whole career but i dont know what will happen next year it could even be my last worlds who knows he said this lightly dont take it too seriously all of my teammates coaching staff front office staff and everyone else are really good people and i really want to do well at worlds to pay them back for their constant support

2455  not sure what the question was

 showmaker i do watch foreign leagues  mostly lpl  lec those leagues have a lot more fights like when my teammates and i are watching well go what theyre really going for this fight

2530  is there a player or team youre looking forward to seeing at worlds

 deft theres this player named canyon  he tells me jungle feels stronger than previous patches and i think hes an exceptionally good player so im looking forward to see what he can do this worlds in terms of teams jdg won msi and they also have players who performed well at asian games so im looking forward to seeing them
 showmaker at worlds the player im looking forward to watching is myself
 kellin i want to play against jdg ruler i dont think ive ever won against him so i want to win this time around

3000  showmaker the comedian

 interviewer what is the name of this documentary again
 showmaker its be the one right
 interviewer no its we are one
 showmaker oh so if we win worlds the name of that documentary can be we won right",Bad Teammates
"dont get me wrong im not an expert on the subject so my opinion probably means squat but ive been playing league for about 8 years so i at least know what some things are or were like the obvious ones are

 meta gotta change things to keep em fresh
 new championsthe sheer number of champions

but after 13 years and what millions upon millions of dollars and you cant even come close to not having both absurdly strong and absurdly weak champions i get it testing the waters is a part of balance but thats what the entire pbe is for and for bugs of course look at duskblade for crying out loud am i expecting perfection  no not in the slightest i just want a decent game where i can actually play and fight the other opponent instead of it being a oneway stomp fest

on a side note do you think infinitely stacking champions pose a threat to balance id love to hear peoples thoughts on that too

"heres my profile httpswwwopggsummonersnale20ninja20panda

it was the game where i had 20 kills and assists as you can see i play xerath in almost all of my games and lose mostly when i play jungler because i suck at jungling lol

teammate told me at the end of the game that i was hitting all my combos too flawlessly i mean its not hard to combo with xerath right farm enough for full ap hit a stun and spam w then q if you dont land the stun wait for the stun cd or poke the enemies with q

anywho enemy team was squishy against my ap so my single q basically took away half their hp with w to finish the kill

"isnt malphite a bit idk turbo broken abusable

52 wr across all elos he dont fall in any fucking elo in this game and he is top 7 most picked champs being a counterpick not blindpickeable

why didnt riot nerf him",Champion Design
"in his most recent videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvspxs6ufs3kk phreak explained his rationale behind the seraphine changes and why theyre not a death knell for seraphine mains ive transcribed some of the video and emphasized some key lines

 disparity between roles
3818 
gt mid and support winrates are 01 apartthey are the exact same power level and despite having the exact same power level support seraphine pickrate is sixteen times midlane seraphine pickrate  

gt we cant really in good conscience buff a  53 winrate champion whos got a respectable pickrate especially in high elo where players optimize for winrate and thus pick a really really high winrate ap champion i think bot lane carry seraphine can be 51 52 thats fine

 4025 
gt we decided to say okay lets bring botlane seraphine whos way up hereand support seraphine is down here and lets bring their power levels together lets have bot seraphine and support seraphine have roughly the same power level that would be nice and as a side goal if we can make seraph midlaner better thats nice but its also so incredibly unpopular it has less that half the pickrate of jungle teemo for exampleits pickrate is nearidentical to that of zyra jungle and zyra jungle is a 46 winrate jungler

gt theres just not that much of a market for seraphine mid and so in terms of serving the sixteen times the number of players who clearly want to play seraphine support and the 116th that number of players who dont play seraphine mid we say were going to serve the sixteen times more players and we have to compensate botlane

5535 
gt its also worth noting that the entire suite of changes is midlane skewed if this is in sum total neutral on winrate this is a midlaneskewed buff and a botlane apcskewed nerf
gt  if less of her power is in the absolutely absurd levels of healing from her w this means more of her power is in her solo lane selfreliant power budget such as my shield is strongerhas a lower cooldown and my q does more damage on a lower cooldown so the w changes are midlane skewed or rather a nerf to everything but midlane now of course teamfight output is of course weaker to be fair w2 is very clearly the best spell to echo its not even close this skill is so overpowered this is where basically all her power is

gt our internal read on winrate magnitude is that this overall set of changes that were still going through is about 05 winrate positive to botlane seraphine and about 3 winrate positive to support seraphine im a little skeptical because i think the w nerf is very very very very large and im kind of relying on it to eat the entire power budget of everything else going on in this changelist because everything else is powerpositive and its like okay this is the only line of a real nerf in the kit

 10040 
gt whats the overall result going to be for this champion its hard to say i think very strongly that support seraphine is going to be quite a bit better i think bot seraphine will roughly tread water i actually have reason to believe that mid seraphine will gain winrate right here i think she will gain less than support seraphine gains because the q is so aggressively skewed towards support builds and not as aggressively good for ap builds but there is definitely a chance that seraphine is just busted next patch and of course there also is the chance to get the numbers wrong and she sucks and if she sucks we buff the champion but the primary goal is to basically lower the gap between bot seraphine and support seraphine because were not allowed to buff seraphine in any role because bot seraphine is too op so we play up her level scaling we play down her gold scaling we play up her enchanter tendencies we play down a little bit her group tendencies and maybe we get to close the gap between botlane and mid and support and that would be great because ti would be great to have her viable at all three roles  
gt its been a pipe dream so far weve always been constrained by mid seraphine being op and support seraphine sucked and then bot seraphines op and support seraphine sucked and now it would be nice if we got all three im not holding my breath but thats the goal

 q changes

 4711 
gt q is getting a shorter cooldown ranks one through four it is getting more base damage ranks two through five and a better ap ratio at rank one the same ap ratio at rank two and a worse ratio rank three four and five now remember what i said earlier about games ending on average with enough gold for three items  
master seraphine gets 65 less gold across their game than silver seraphine botlane which is to say its much more likely that low elo seraphine actually finishes three items than masters seraphine finishes three items  
the rational thought is that q is strictly stronger at rank one strictly stronger at rank two strictly stronger at rank three strictly stronger at rank four and then stronger at rank five from minutes nine through twentyseven until you finish seraphs embrace do not let anyone tell you the seraphine changes are a nerf because they are not they pretty much cant be there is a part of time where the spell is weaker that is paid for by the first 25 minutes being stronger and that means that by her being stronger at winning 1v1s and getting lane priority and winning teamfights and securing objectives and killing turrets pays for more ability power to further offset where she would be weaker in a real game the acute changes are a strict buff to seraphine  
q is strictly buffed it is more buffed for support than for a farm lane but it is overall buffed for the champion no ifs ands or buts q change is a strict buff to seraphine if this was the only change she would gain winrate in every single role she plays do not let anyone tell you otherwise theyre wrong

 w changes

5314 
gt by having the shield go up per rank and the cooldown go down per rank and though the rank one ability mana cost goes up the mana cost per rank goes down there are three levers here that all say maxing w is better than it was before its worth noting that again because support seraphine does not get a lot of ability power maxing q is also better than before so well see which way they go but it is going to be a lot of power to support seraphine in both of those cases 
gt im believing pretty strongly we should never get anywhere close to sonas level of cooldown spamming w on a short cooldown feels more like sonas sort of thing and so leaving this a as a relatively long cooldown because it does shield your entire team and can be doublecasted for minimum 300 shield to your team before ap ratiothats a lot of power thats a way shorter cooldown and actually more shielding than karma e so we have to be pretty respectful here this can get way too powerful way too fast
gt the final change to w as compensation is a pretty significant nerf to the heal of a repeatcast w so not only is the base heal going down by 2 missing health at all ranks but also the ap ratio is going away entirely there is no longer an ap ratio on the w

 e changes

 5916 
gt the e changes are strictly midlane buffs e cost per rank goes down from ten per rank to five per rank and the e damage is  a meaningful damage increase at max rank 60 max rank so its fifteen damage per rank up so if you get to that lategame mid seraphine scenario where you finally have more ability power you finally finish the third item even though the game ended the moment you finish the third item congratulations e does more damage now and makes up for your damage in front of q so again shes just a stronger mage than before the upto60 extra damage on e of course that is very late in the game and often not reached but even the 15 at level 14 is easily reached  this is basically a freebie midlane lever to say hey her level scaling is probably going to be a bit better now its much harder for bot and support seraphine to get the later levels",Champion Design

riot flags mentally unstable players tracked by reportchat behaviouretc somehow and groups 23 of these together per game in the same team andor people who are having crazy winlosing streaks to match them

i had a 12game winstreak yesterday where every single game was with absolutely textbook perfect teammates sure not everyone was winning lane always but it was civil teamwork to get wins today i lost 8 out of 9 games and its crazy how toxic my teammates were especially the past 3 games im talking about deliberately trolling teammates not moving at all when getting a gank from your jgl as a protest and general griefing in chat it really felt so obvious that the game will be lost not only because we were on the worse end skill wise but because it was a mental implosion to the point where it seemed as if players were bots

so i see many many builds with void staff and lord dom and other magic and armor pen items in those builds but is it still recommended to build it if they have 1 or no tanks in the enemy team for example if the enemy team is not building any magic resist or maybe one enemy is building mr would it still be recommended to build a void staff or can i build another item instead that would be more efficient thank you ,Bad Teammates

asol already put the stakes high in the first convergence the ruination broke this ceiling the void is kind of left feeling like a secondary antagonist now when the intention is that its the one antagonistic device which has some consensus of it being the big bad for all characters

onto the main topic last spoiler warning

lor introduced the event of a second daarkin war between xolaani and aatrox or their respective factions there are about 9 new daarkins with two to four of them will address within xolaani faction anaakca ibaaros taaroshnaganeka naganeka and taarosh are the reason for 24 of them note that naganeka was initially neutral but forced into the faction by xolaanis enslavement though defeated by kayle note that taarosh who was sealed by myisha or the previous zoe during the first daarkin war in the moment of defeating xolaani upon being freed wished to join aatrox but was also enslaved anaakca and ibaaros are the two willing supporters

ampx200b

styraatu is a aatrox faction daarkin which was imprisoned in what became zaun shes the funny haha harpon daarkin she destroyed the processing plant in her reawakening from sheer rage against xolaani so the splash art lta hrefhttpsstaticwikianocookienetleagueoflegendsimages55e06pz008t2fullpngrevisionlatestcb20221007171646gtlinkltagt shows the citadel  of piltover destroyed by styraatu which should imply that a lot of zaun is destroyed alongside the question i have is in the timeline consistency with arcane since this splash art is yet to be shown as existing you could draw a presumption that the second daarkin war comes after arcane events or is yet to be shown in arcane 



summarizing do you think that the second daarkin war will be shown or hinted to be ongoing by showing styraatus destruction in arcane if not when do you think these two events will be on the timeline",Ranked Pressure

"earlier today dplus kia released a 30 min video on their youtube page httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo1aj5bccvcihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo1aj5bccvci with pretty lengthy interviews  video clips with each player i think en translations are delayed until next week but here are some highlights

430  dk players submitting worlds pickem

 canyon who will get the most penta kills who did you guys pick
 showmaker i picked deft we have to give him a penta deft never got a penta in his entire lck or worlds career
 deft wow if i get a penta at worlds
 canyon but i picked ruler
 showmaker ah sh to deft he said he picked ruler really we could even run into jdg
 deft ok well im voting for kanavi now

540  question is did you ever think there was a chance you would not qualify for worlds

 deft when summer split ended we were in a really worrying situation but playoffs scrims went really well so after that i felt like we would make worlds 100
 kellin yeah we overcame a lot of issues during playoffs and now worlds scrims are also going super well
 deft i feel like we got a lot closer during in game comms later in the season irl we were always pretty friendly from the start but it took some time to get that same closeness in game for example if a teammate makes a mistake they arent so worried now about how other teammates might react in game

825  excerpts of in game comms during scrims

 kellin canna dont worry bot lane is over were good
 showmaker canna if you can just group and be a warm body we can win
 canna im not sure if i can even do that lol
 showmaker yes you can lol our top wave state does make me want to quit the game though
 i think eventually enemy team ffed the scrim

1818  question is how is the team spirit now

 showmaker after regional finals the team morale has been really good i would say worlds is a really fun experience  compared to lck theres a lot more nerves and a lot more at stake weve all been to worlds before and in order to reproduce for canyondeftsm that amazing feeling when you win worlds everyone is giving extra effort and i think thats contributing to the team spirit
 canna i think our team synergy has improved a lot like were better at matching each others picks and creating a cohesive team comp now
 canyon weve been playing together for like 8 months now so i think our teamwork is really good at this point
 deft i also feel like our drafts are a lot cleaner now than they were in early season

2136 

 interviewer so worlds is the last time the 5 of you will be playing together
 showmaker ye but we could still play together next year the last time well its true ive been at dk for my whole career but i dont know what will happen next year it could even be my last worlds who knows he said this lightly dont take it too seriously all of my teammates coaching staff front office staff and everyone else are really good people and i really want to do well at worlds to pay them back for their constant support

2455  not sure what the question was

 showmaker i do watch foreign leagues  mostly lpl  lec those leagues have a lot more fights like when my teammates and i are watching well go what theyre really going for this fight

2530  is there a player or team youre looking forward to seeing at worlds

 deft theres this player named canyon  he tells me jungle feels stronger than previous patches and i think hes an exceptionally good player so im looking forward to see what he can do this worlds in terms of teams jdg won msi and they also have players who performed well at asian games so im looking forward to seeing them
 showmaker at worlds the player im looking forward to watching is myself
 kellin i want to play against jdg ruler i dont think ive ever won against him so i want to win this time around

3000  showmaker the comedian

 interviewer what is the name of this documentary again
 showmaker its be the one right
 interviewer no its we are one
 showmaker oh so if we win worlds the name of that documentary can be we won right",Bad Teammates

"everyone is frustrated at the ping changes and there is record of the rioter who announced the change feeding in a game when their teammate spam pinged them alive at the end of the game

recently khazix who is struggling in the jungle had their buffs seemingly pulled from the upcoming patch with no reason given

its just odd as someone else pointed out that people like phreak who are known for giving super detailed reasoning behind changes made big or small has been super vague and basically just said jungle op so we nerf as reasoning for such a huge change to an entire role

the final thing that i think is most reasonable is the score like s a b c d but im not sure since the scoring is incredibly strict somtimes i think i did really well in a match but the game still scored me a b max

"in the swiss format you qualify to playoffs by going 30 31 or 32 and you get knocked out if you go 03 13 or 23 lets assume the most negative scenario for the west eastern
teams take the two 30 slots and the three 31 slots and qualify well give western teams a bit of a break and let gam get knocked out 03 or 13 along with four western teams this leaves
three western and three eastern teams at 22 if any western teams draw each other about 60 one is guaranteed top 8 in the other case east vs west east vs west and east vs west some of the best western teams at the tournament get three opportunities to
beat some of the weaker eastern teams at the tournament well be pessimistic and say each western team only has  around a 15 chance of winning their bo3 at 22 against the eastern team thats still  40 10853 for any western team to win their matchup

"one thing i keep seeing is the random and wrong statement that jinx would have won that fight last patch anyway the passive being stackable doesnt change anything  
first off there are close fights where this passive compeletly throws the game off balance  
secondly its not just about winning the fight she is ending games way too quickly right after a team fight before if she won the fight they got inhib and backed off but now she can insta remove turrets in fact after a team fight jinx is able to takedown turrets faster than she takes canon pre fight

now she did get 2 more buffs this patch 100 gt 105 hp growth and slight base base damage and ad ration on ult 5 seconds off ult as well  
  
but those buffs alone are not strong enough on their own to make it a 2 difference  
lets look at some chartshttpsimgurcomagtwn0wl   
as you can see she has gotten a massive boost of 5 winrate in mid game and that is all due to her getting 5 stacks from a team fight and having the ability to end the game at around 25 minute by insta removing turrets  
   
  
if you look at 1520 to 2530 part of the game length you can see a noticeable curve and slightly reduced game times between those times  
  
now jinx deserved buffs for sure she was one of the worst adcs for sure but the direction of the buff is just toxic  
no champion should be able to remove turrets with that speed just because they won a team fight that they could have done barely any damage and just got 5 assists  
  
in fact hasnt jinxs passive has always been an issue if you give her 1 ad too much she kills 1 person fast enough to turn it into a penta and if you give her 1 less ad then she cant even get any kills at all",Bad Teammates
"im gold 1 atm and whenever i get jayce on my team it just feels like an automatic loss hes supposed to be a lane bully if youre skilled enough but every time i see it they just go even or lose lane by the time 20 minutes rolls around they basically turn into a caster minion for the rest of the game but almost worse since they almost always miss their one skill shot either that or they jump on like a melee minion and die within 2 seconds

answer yourself honestly how often do you really pay attention to the summoner names of other players or even use them to communicate instead of adressing them by the name of their champion

from my experience 99 of the time people use champion names or dont communcate at all and the last time i saw someone pay attention to a clever joke or refference in someones name was probably during season 4

not to mention that there are a lot of player who never cared about their summoner names anway and simply used a gibbersish of letters and numbers or generic words just to have a name and play the game

additionally lols playerbase is so huge that running into someone with the same name as yours or someone elses is going to border on a miracle unless youre playing in masters and above where player count gets really low

there is also the topic of impersonation and use of names of people popular in the lol community but that has been happening for years through use of special characters and other tricks so not much is going to change there has been a very small handful of instances of me playing aginst or with someone who i thought could be a youtuber only to find out that theyre some kid who barely speaks english and knows the most colorful combinations of racial slures in the world

 there is the prospect of people who got their desired name joinked being able to finally use them and this is also potentially going to put rest to name reselling

" hextech gunblade was in the game for 10 years i honestly never heard the community complain about it occasionally some would say it made katakali oppressive but those champs were top tier for years after the item was removed anyway compare it to complaints from stopwatch banner of command hullbreaker stridbreakerdash active etc it was never an item anyone truly had an issue with it was actually a lot of fun people loved it everyone did

arguments against

1 but it acutally will make katakali oppressive  shut up who cares figure out how to deal with it
2 but it gives champs without cc cc and wiping away drool from chin champs with ccextra cc  so what shut up
3 sustain is not stammering s s supposed to be in thbe game anymore  so what shut up
4 it will loudly breathing and swallows saliva throw off the meta  the meta is boring and sucks anyway so what shut up
5 blah blah blah insert any argument against bringing gunblade back next patch  shut up

having an extra way to interact and make plays in the game via an item is 100x more fun than solely relying on your champs kit it allowed for more brainmode plays and it has plenty of counterplay still its not an auto win item think of all the screaming the lcs casters can do when somebody zap kills someone think of the pogchamps in lcs twitch chat

much of the sustain the game used to have has been removed or mitigated but i dont see how anyone can possibly find lack of sustainhealing fun it just means that you have to go back and forth from fountain far more often and are less able to make plays after a fight or duel zzzzzzzz the heal on the item wasnt overly op anyway it allowed you to gradually heal back to full health after 2 to 4 full minion waves depending on the point in the game and sustain a bit in lane example if kayle is vs malphite it allows kayle to somewhat persist in lane rather than permanently losing 13hp from one mindless malphite q and having to back or getting 1 shot ulted scoffs loudly ah ha hes a kayle player that explains why he wants it back1  shhhh be quiet

theres apparently a trend to pull away a bit from item actives wow thats so fun only playing in my little niche while another lane loses and having no agency or carry potential is not fun gunblade allows for more playmaking and opportunities to the champions that build it its a 3600 gold item so its something you have to work for as well

just bring it back if it truly messes stuff up then you can get rid of it again the game is the most straight up dead and boring grindfest its ever been the worst player in the game has too much agency and matchups have too little counterplay giving players an item that give people more opportunities and possibilities to carry is better for everyone better for me better for you yes you because everyone can build it me you your top your mid anyone that wants it im going to build one right now in my garage",Champion Design

theres only magic penetration for ap  
and theres armor penetration lethality armor decrease for ad seriously  


since the qol update where every champion got for a bit more tanky how do you expect ap to compete with ad   


you need 3 ap items 25 mejais stacks to be useful as a mage play pixel perfect play around your cd hit all your abilities position well whereas you need 12 items on ad without needing to consider anything else just right click and kite and youre already 1v9ing  


tanks they legit deal more damage than mages and can frontline as much youd like  
bruisers same shit  
adc just hope you have rakan in your team to cc chain enemy engagers so you can right click and eat popcorn with left hand coughs riot phreak boutta buff some adcs so they can withstand 70wr in bronzeplat elo so he can get out finally and use reason how graphically theyre all low wr in high elo  
support lux brand morgana zyra heim theyre all unfair and broken champions theyre supposed to be support poke you in lane yes but not make you recall every 2 seconds reduce the damages from champs who have poke kit in early game or reduce their stunsslows man legit you cant touch these guys reduce their turretsplants hp or something find the perfect balance youre the balancing team you dont even listen to your own communitys advices who are playing this game and firsthand experiencing all of this

"before i continue this post i mainly play  champs that scales harder the longer the game progress such as kaylekassadinazirsiontrynd you name it so this dosent really effect me this is not a rant

i am just curious

ampx200b

here is the thing

turrets are already fortified and now with this patch  you get less gold from plates

shorter respawn timer so if the enemy you killed has tp they will  get to lane much faster so they can immediately catchup on you with gold and xp

runes for mainly duelists has been nerfed such as conq tempo and pta

those sweet doran buffs with extra hp  damage allow certain champs to last much longer during laning phase even against strong duelists who can stat check them

ampx200b

so what purpose does early  champions that falls off later serve

if the enemy team has any decent macro and just play safe farm up dont risk to much it will be very difficult to end the game early and then the game will slowly but surely snowball into their favor depending on their comp and yours of course

now with 1320 its much easier to do this

so are early game champs still worth playing if most games can last for 3545 minutes

"okay trust me the title doesnt say the full picture of my thoughts im a lpl fan and i do think lpl should be the slight favorites for this worlds because of this insane jdg team and great lpl summer split but i think im unlike other lpl fans that im not confident about the overall lpl showing at all and this is because of the swiss stage a lpl team implodes in worlds every single goddamn year and im honestly getting a bit traumatized by it feels like ever since 2020 every lpl team gets rated highly coming into worlds but 1 or 2 teams shit the bed in group stage while lck gets every team in quarters im tired of this expectation just to feel depressed in group this year swiss stage so im fully expecting wbg and one of blglng to not make it at this point if they all do ill be very pleasantly surprised and happy but im not expecting it 

but once lpl reaches the knockout stage im very confident in them i thought that edg could genuinely win vs dk when they were huge underdogs i thought rng were as good as t1 when the 180 t1 roster was considered by fans to be the greatest roster ever

the crazy thing is that i think lpl has a much higher chance of winning worlds than actually getting all 4 teams into knockout stage the scrims rumor so far support this happening again as well im not one of those ppl who think scrims dont matter well its fair if you do but the current scrim rumor is that the best scrim teams are all lck teams and jdgg2 all lck teams and the chinese 1st seed in semis has happened for the last 2 years albeit due to different reasons such as cn vs cn in quarters and fpx drama but it doesnt inspire confidence

"i have seen alot of talon posts these days and they are absolutely right 

talon is an old champion with only 121 min of generic voice lines which are soo bad jhin has 241 voice lines

his in game design didnt change since 2011  they changed his kit but didnt change his looks he has alot of bugs in game and alot of people see him clunky and bad

talon made it to 546 days with no skins at all and 12 years old with no legendary skin at all kayn got 2 already and he is not so old
talon needs to be changed and someone needs to so something about it",Champion Design
"this champion feels so awkward now i truly dont understand who playtested this and thought it was ok instead of actually addressing the core of his issues they only made him clunky to play and added more frustration points for his enemies 

if i was to make a knee jerk change i would have hit his mana costs reduce the survivability of one of his abilities like reducing his shield or reducing his dr in w or reducing his base stats even a change like only gaining a shield if you e an ally would be more interesting than what they ended up doing they made compensation changes that also make him more annoying and rewarding bad play such as q still slowing during all out or for some stupid reason buffing the ult damage on not hitting a wall and nerfing the damage of actually hitting a wall why are they giving attack speed to a champion who has 3 auto reset abilities every change is made to help horrible players and these players will still be bad what is the point

one of the selling points of this game has been the fluid gameplay mixed with animation cancelling a large part of the roster especially champs made after 2012 have ways of animation cancelling and if you learn how to do this your dpsefficiency can be dramatically improved with ksante being able to tap w allowed you to do around 5 different combos and mixing flash into it extends this further other champions have the same interactions riven can animation cancel every ability yasuo and yone can reposition their knock ups with flash shen can flash during his dash to reposition and get a guaranteed taunt camille can use her e to get an instant auto reset and can even flash during her e to react to an opponent making a dodge master yi can tap meditate to reset his auto attack there are so many interactions you can learn if you just put in the time but they keep making changes that are aimed to help bad players and reduce the impact these characters have in pro play why remove features from some characters but not others 

also i feel like the developers really dont understand how these mechanics all come with a cost me being able to flash q3 by definition forces me to work around a cooldown that is tremendous and if i mess up i will be rightfully punished why is that a bad thing if i come up with a combo that depends on a high cost spell i should be rewarded for pulling it off 

there are too many cases where they change a champion to help bad play and punish creativity and dedication irelia jax swain illaoi and ksante are just a few examples of champions getting dumbed down for the sake of proplay and bronze win rates

i hope they stop doing this and outright revert the changes imagine if jax had to hold his counter strike for 75 of its max duration imagine if riven had to wait for her q animation to finish every time she wanted to auto attack maybe leesin shouldnt be able to flash during his ultimate by the logic they are going with ksante the insec lee sin ult shouldnt exist 

sorry this was a rant im just tired of these developers making the game more boring and watching passionate mains lose interest really puts me down i want this game to succeed but it is clear that the developers do not play the same game

edit these comments really illustrate how bad players refuse to adapt and learn new things taking away mechanics from champions will not make the game easier for you and improve your ability to fight these champions bronze and silver will still complain about ksante",Champion Design

after looking more deeply at potential first round draws the bad first round draw ends up not being too bad because after this round were getting a round of east vs east and west vs west matchups round two draws end up not mattering as much for the same reason the biggest swings in probability were in round 3 and onward draws

"i think this patch was the wrong approach 

i think jungle is in a healthy state when the priority for it is objectives with team gt invading gt stealing enemy camps gt ganking gt afk farming 

this makes it so junglers get to pvp but against the enemy jungler and not against laners 

how would i do that 
3 things

1 make ganking harder
this can be achieved by reducing ward cds maybe letting laners start with 2 ward charges 

2 make invading more rewarding
reduce catch up xp by alot make it so if you invade and get the kill you actually get time to take 12 camps 

3 make jungler be stronger in jungle
right now laners especially mid can invade alot of junglers on their first clear and kill them or at least force a flash and completely ruin their camp sequence an idea would be to give junglers damageresistance buff inside the jungle for the first 10 minutes for example this way its good if they get less xpgold than laners this makes ganking harder but protects them from invades of non junglers while the enemy jungler can still invade and kill

i beleave this would result in more fun junglers that duel each other for camps and not just full clear or perma gank lanes 

right now it literally doesnt matter if the enemy jungler steals a camp he can be up 50cs and it doesnt make any difference its the only lane that works like that if you top is up 50 cs he will completely stomp the other guy but in jungle it doesnt matter at all since your only fighting at an advantage anyway",Champion Design

"any other top laners using swap picks to get 5th pick most games i was having a hard time climbing because i like picks that have some nasty counters like riven or some other melee champs that are feast or famine

so lately my desire to win has been greater than my desire to play x champ so every preselect i ask for 5th pick include heart emojis and also sometimes i use ladder swapping so if im 1st pick i swap for 3rd pick then once im 3rd pick 4th doesnt mind swapping then 5th pick

ampx200b

my win rate has gone from 44 to 54 in the past few weeks with some 164 wl streaks its extremely effective but only if you know how to play most top laners and esp in platgoldsilver so if youve been playing league for some years and like to play all the champs this is a perfect strategy for you

ampx200b

i basically just counter pick the strongest counters to my enemy top laner only tough situations are if you dont get last pick top infrequently lately for me or if they have flex picks even including those two limiting factors they dont seem to effect me much

ampx200b

im stomping every lane and my skill hasnt gotten better just by counterpicking top the only guideline i use is the champ has to be in the top 3 lane winners its kind of dumb honestly how easy every game is now

ampx200b

i have a spreadsheet with who my counters are

if they pick aatrox i lock in ireliaolaf they pick camille i lock in wwrenektonteemo

darius kennenteemovolipantheonjayce

olaf akalitrundledariussett

nasus voliilloairenekton

teemo naafiricassolafyasuoirelia

garen a really fun one ap varus wbarrier camille akshan

ampx200b

i assume once i hit like diamond this strategy will have diminishing returns because some one tricks will be able to play their champ better then me but its really turned around my league experience completely the only qualification to this strat is that youve been playing for a long time and are one of those i have 2030 games on every champ kinda player or know how these matchups go

ampx200b

its way way easier than knowing how a skill matchup goes when olaf is lvl 4 and jayce is lvl 4 both with ignite you completely subvert that because in most of these matchups its closer to a hard counter again at least in platgoldsilver so you win most trades

even if i play badly i still beat garen with varus or camille or beat nasus with volibear or teemo with naafiricass or olaf with akali so even though im a bit rusty on these champs it doesnt matter because the matchup is so good really great for lowmid mmr players

"in his most recent videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvspxs6ufs3kk phreak explained his rationale behind the seraphine changes and why theyre not a death knell for seraphine mains ive transcribed some of the video and emphasized some key lines

 disparity between roles
3818 
gt mid and support winrates are 01 apartthey are the exact same power level and despite having the exact same power level support seraphine pickrate is sixteen times midlane seraphine pickrate  

gt we cant really in good conscience buff a  53 winrate champion whos got a respectable pickrate especially in high elo where players optimize for winrate and thus pick a really really high winrate ap champion i think bot lane carry seraphine can be 51 52 thats fine

 4025 
gt we decided to say okay lets bring botlane seraphine whos way up hereand support seraphine is down here and lets bring their power levels together lets have bot seraphine and support seraphine have roughly the same power level that would be nice and as a side goal if we can make seraph midlaner better thats nice but its also so incredibly unpopular it has less that half the pickrate of jungle teemo for exampleits pickrate is nearidentical to that of zyra jungle and zyra jungle is a 46 winrate jungler

gt theres just not that much of a market for seraphine mid and so in terms of serving the sixteen times the number of players who clearly want to play seraphine support and the 116th that number of players who dont play seraphine mid we say were going to serve the sixteen times more players and we have to compensate botlane

5535 
gt its also worth noting that the entire suite of changes is midlane skewed if this is in sum total neutral on winrate this is a midlaneskewed buff and a botlane apcskewed nerf
gt  if less of her power is in the absolutely absurd levels of healing from her w this means more of her power is in her solo lane selfreliant power budget such as my shield is strongerhas a lower cooldown and my q does more damage on a lower cooldown so the w changes are midlane skewed or rather a nerf to everything but midlane now of course teamfight output is of course weaker to be fair w2 is very clearly the best spell to echo its not even close this skill is so overpowered this is where basically all her power is

gt our internal read on winrate magnitude is that this overall set of changes that were still going through is about 05 winrate positive to botlane seraphine and about 3 winrate positive to support seraphine im a little skeptical because i think the w nerf is very very very very large and im kind of relying on it to eat the entire power budget of everything else going on in this changelist because everything else is powerpositive and its like okay this is the only line of a real nerf in the kit

 10040 
gt whats the overall result going to be for this champion its hard to say i think very strongly that support seraphine is going to be quite a bit better i think bot seraphine will roughly tread water i actually have reason to believe that mid seraphine will gain winrate right here i think she will gain less than support seraphine gains because the q is so aggressively skewed towards support builds and not as aggressively good for ap builds but there is definitely a chance that seraphine is just busted next patch and of course there also is the chance to get the numbers wrong and she sucks and if she sucks we buff the champion but the primary goal is to basically lower the gap between bot seraphine and support seraphine because were not allowed to buff seraphine in any role because bot seraphine is too op so we play up her level scaling we play down her gold scaling we play up her enchanter tendencies we play down a little bit her group tendencies and maybe we get to close the gap between botlane and mid and support and that would be great because ti would be great to have her viable at all three roles  
gt its been a pipe dream so far weve always been constrained by mid seraphine being op and support seraphine sucked and then bot seraphines op and support seraphine sucked and now it would be nice if we got all three im not holding my breath but thats the goal

 q changes

 4711 
gt q is getting a shorter cooldown ranks one through four it is getting more base damage ranks two through five and a better ap ratio at rank one the same ap ratio at rank two and a worse ratio rank three four and five now remember what i said earlier about games ending on average with enough gold for three items  
master seraphine gets 65 less gold across their game than silver seraphine botlane which is to say its much more likely that low elo seraphine actually finishes three items than masters seraphine finishes three items  
the rational thought is that q is strictly stronger at rank one strictly stronger at rank two strictly stronger at rank three strictly stronger at rank four and then stronger at rank five from minutes nine through twentyseven until you finish seraphs embrace do not let anyone tell you the seraphine changes are a nerf because they are not they pretty much cant be there is a part of time where the spell is weaker that is paid for by the first 25 minutes being stronger and that means that by her being stronger at winning 1v1s and getting lane priority and winning teamfights and securing objectives and killing turrets pays for more ability power to further offset where she would be weaker in a real game the acute changes are a strict buff to seraphine  
q is strictly buffed it is more buffed for support than for a farm lane but it is overall buffed for the champion no ifs ands or buts q change is a strict buff to seraphine if this was the only change she would gain winrate in every single role she plays do not let anyone tell you otherwise theyre wrong

 w changes

5314 
gt by having the shield go up per rank and the cooldown go down per rank and though the rank one ability mana cost goes up the mana cost per rank goes down there are three levers here that all say maxing w is better than it was before its worth noting that again because support seraphine does not get a lot of ability power maxing q is also better than before so well see which way they go but it is going to be a lot of power to support seraphine in both of those cases 
gt im believing pretty strongly we should never get anywhere close to sonas level of cooldown spamming w on a short cooldown feels more like sonas sort of thing and so leaving this a as a relatively long cooldown because it does shield your entire team and can be doublecasted for minimum 300 shield to your team before ap ratiothats a lot of power thats a way shorter cooldown and actually more shielding than karma e so we have to be pretty respectful here this can get way too powerful way too fast
gt the final change to w as compensation is a pretty significant nerf to the heal of a repeatcast w so not only is the base heal going down by 2 missing health at all ranks but also the ap ratio is going away entirely there is no longer an ap ratio on the w

 e changes

 5916 
gt the e changes are strictly midlane buffs e cost per rank goes down from ten per rank to five per rank and the e damage is  a meaningful damage increase at max rank 60 max rank so its fifteen damage per rank up so if you get to that lategame mid seraphine scenario where you finally have more ability power you finally finish the third item even though the game ended the moment you finish the third item congratulations e does more damage now and makes up for your damage in front of q so again shes just a stronger mage than before the upto60 extra damage on e of course that is very late in the game and often not reached but even the 15 at level 14 is easily reached  this is basically a freebie midlane lever to say hey her level scaling is probably going to be a bit better now its much harder for bot and support seraphine to get the later levels",Champion Design

"evelynn is currently a s tier jungler according to ugg and is sitting at 53 winrate with a 15 banratehttpsugglolchampionsevelynnbuild at master and challenger her banrate surpasses 18 she also has been an s tier jungler for a ton of patches she is also one of the very few champions which can build mejai and get away with it due to her massive safety allowing her to avoid dying

the issue with evelynn is that traditional form of counterplay against both classes junglers and assassins doesnt work against evelynn

 against most other junglers you can just ward this will make their ganks telegraphed allowing you to react accordingly against junglers that can either become invisible bypass walls or have a long range dash and can gank from different angles such as zac khazix shaco kayn you can ward in other places even though warding becomes more difficult
  this doesnt work against evelynn why because she is perpetually invisible it only works before level 6 after that your only option is to either give up lane dominance or risk being ganked by her because evelynn is perpetually invisible warding doesnt work because you can only use one pink ward and evelynn can just gank from other angles and she will ignore normal wards due to that you can ward evelynns camps to know where she is and guess where she will gank but that isnt feasible because you have too a limited number of wards to use and it is not just you but your allies also need to ward her camps which is a massive level of coordination that you cant find in your average soloq game also unlike rengar evelynn can avoid activating her w which makes her ganks even less telegraphed even if they will be weaker if she doesnt use w

 against most other assassins you can pick tanks or bulky juggernauts they cant be bursted from full health like squishies can for obvious reasons health and resistance stacking prevents that assassins can kill them but only when they have been significantly weakened enough or if they are behind enough
  this doesnt work against evelynn why because her w shreds a percentage of your magic resistance not a flat amount so it works even against magic resistance stacking her e does damage based on your max health and the percentage scales with ap unlike most other percentage health mechanisms in the game and her r does a ton more damage if you are weakened enough so not only evelynn can bypass resistances and health stacking from tanks unlike other assassins she has a much easier time finishing them off once they are weakened enough this invalidates tanks as a form of counterplay against evelynn

evelynn is just broken but people somehow refuse to admit that she is they say that she is balanced easily counterable telegraphed that only low elo players die to her none of this is true as i explained

"tldr jungler xp penalties should not reduce the total xp received by the team

ampx200b

junglers receive less xp from lane minions prior to 20 minutes as i understand it this amount is calculated after the xp share is calculated in the current state this means that junglers sharing any lane xp prior to 20 minutes actually reduces the total xp that your team receives

here are a few scenarios where this is problematic

 helping a laner shove out a wave after a successful gank  especially with reduced respawn timers repairing wave state prior to recalling is more important than ever historically laners were usually happy to share this xp with a jungler in exchange for a better wave state and time to recall but if the xp received by the jungler does not make up for the xp lost by sharing the team that won the exchange will suffer 
 helping a losing laner breaking a freeze maybe even defending dives  in situations where a laner is already behind they will often request help from the jungler to mitigate the damage of a losing lane when a team is already at a disadvantage junglers who chose to help a laner actually end up reducing their teams total xp even before considering the opportunity cost of losing camps  objectives elsewhere on the map
 when losing towers  inhibitors  as towers  inhibitors are taken additional siege minions and super minions spawn for the aggressing team this provides the aggressors additional map pressure but also gives the defenders access to more xp as compensation defending junglers may lose the ability to safely access the jungle in these stages of the game and must stay further back on the map with their team without access to camps a jungler is forced to share xp with their team reducing the total xp that their team receives 

as stands right now this mechanic runs counter to the intended behavior of xp sharing  when members of a team are sharing xp the total xp pool is increased in order to compensate for the lower overall xp that each champion receives when one of the champions sharing xp is a jungler nonjunglers are still penalized the same amount for their presence but the jungler only gets to keep a fraction of the xp they took from their teammates if minion xp is going to be used as a lever to balance the jungle role it should be implemented in a way that does not impact the teams overall xp received from minions

ampx200b

now lets put some numbers behind this to understand how much of an impact this really has for context solo xp is granted at a rate of 95 and shared xp is granted at a rate of 116 sourcehttpsleagueoflegendsfandomcomwikiexperience_champion a single wave is 270 xp for a solo laner or 330 xp when shared the examples below are based on shoving a minion wave but the same logic applies to any scenario where the jungler is sharing minion xp

impact at 4 minutes

at 4 minutes into the game the jungler is receiving an xp penalty of 56

solo lane

 if a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave the solo laner will receive 165 xp which is a reduction of 38 due to xp sharing and the jungler would receive 44 of that which is 73 xp
 the team will receive 238 total xp which is 12 less than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all and 28 less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

bot lane

 if a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave each bot laner will receive 110 xp which is a reduction of 33 due to xp sharing and the jungler will receive 44 of that which is 48 xp
 the team will receive 268 total xp which is 19 less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave 

impact at 6 minutes

at 6 minutes into the game the jungler is receiving an xp penalty of 50

solo lane

 if a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave the solo laner will receive 165 xp which is a reduction of 38 due to xp sharing and the jungler would receive 50 of that which is 83 xp
 the team will receive 248 total xp which is 8 less than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all and 25 less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

bot lane

 if a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave each bot laner will receive 110 xp which is a reduction of 33 due to xp sharing and the jungler will receive 50 of that which is 55 xp
 the team will receive 276 total xp which is 17 less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

impact at 10 minutes

at 10 minutes into the game the jungler is receiving an xp penalty of 35

solo lane

 if a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave the solo laner will receive 165 xp which is a reduction of 38 due to xp sharing and the jungler would receive 65 of that which is 107 xp
 the team will receive 273 total xp which is 1 more than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all and 18 less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

bot lane

 if a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave each bot laner will receive 110 xp which is a reduction of 33 due to xp sharing and the jungler will receive 65 of that which is 72 xp
 the team will receive 292 total xp which is 12 less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave 

impact at 14 minutes

at 14 minutes into the game the jungler is receiving an xp penalty of 21

solo lane

 if a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave the solo laner will receive 165 xp which is a reduction of 38 due to xp sharing and the jungler would receive 79 of that which is 131 xp
 the team will receive 296 total xp which is 9 more than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all and 11 less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

bot lane

 if a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave each bot laner will receive 110 xp which is a reduction of 33 due to xp sharing and the jungler will receive 79 of that which is 87 xp
 the team will receive 307 total xp which is 7 less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave 

ampx200b

how should this be fixed

lost minion xp should be refunded to nonjunglers 

consider the example of a jungler helping to shove a solo lane wave at 4 minutes into the game currently the laner would receive 165 xp and the jungler would receive 73 xp for a total of 238 xp this leaves 32 xp that is completely lost just because the jungler is in the lane give this 32 xp back to the laner so they will now receive 197 xp this is still 28 less xp than the laner would receive if they shoved the wave themselves but now the team as a whole will not be receiving less xp simply due to the jungle being the one who helped shove the wave

the new laner xp can be calculated by subtracting the xp received by the jungler from the total xp received if the jungler were not present for a solo laner that formula would look like this solo_xp  shared_xp  jungle_xp_multiplier

270  165  44  197

ampx200b

in the current state how can i mitigate the impact of jungle xp penalties on my team

 junglers should avoid sharing xp with solo laners prior to 10 minutes not only does the laner receive less xp when the jungler is there but the xp that the jungler receive does not even make up for it until 10 minutes into the game
 junglers should avoid sharing xp with two or more laners for most of the game the total penalty to the team for a jungler sharing xp with bot lane at 10 minutes is the same as the penalty for sharing xp with a solo lane at 4 minutes this penalty steadily decreases throughout the game but does not go away until the jungle xp penalty expires at 20 minutes  keep those ganks short and sweet
 when possible supports and other nonjunglers should help fix waves instead of junglers especially early on in the game

besides the toxicity one thing i tend to see people say regarding why they dont play league is that matches are too long and with the upcoming preseason changes im worried the average match length will get even longer

let me get this out of the way yes wild rift exists and it has 1520 minute matches but its a mobile game and people might not like playing games on their phones or they simply dont have a powerful enough one to run the game plus wr doesnt have every champ and skin that pc does

so as a very casual player of pvp games all i want is a permanent nongimmicky so not like urf mode like dota 2s turbo mode tfts hyper roll or valorants swift play just the base game mode but much faster with this existing people who want the regular mode to be longer and slower could get what they want right

"hi all

so im writing this in the hopes riot will consider implementing so additional information regarding how effective items are currently most items show how much additional healing shielding damage etc they are giving and in some cases spirit visage eclipse divine sunderer we can see multiple types of benefits

currently there are a few missing that i think would be good to see most notably the new adc mythics are all lacking information as to their additional damage output

infinity edge additional crit damage

navori quickblades additional crit damage and cd reduction

bloodthirster additional damage and healing done

collector number of executes and gold

lord dominics additional damage through  pen 

voidstaff through additional pen

rylais crystal scepter time slowed sec

cosmic drive movement speed active sec

riftmaker healing done

shieldbow healing done

blade of the ruined king healing done

ravenous hydra healing done

mortal reminder damage from  pen

guinsoos rageblade on hit damage done additional on hit damage done for other items producing off this and additional damage done from pen

seryldas grudge additional damage from pen and time slowed sec

divine sunderer additional damage from pen

plated steel caps damage reduced from auto attacks

eclipse additional damage from pen

runaans hurricane additional damage from on hit damage and additional damage from on hit damage from other items

i feel adding these would give players a lot more clarity on what their items are actually doing ingame as the many already showing these details do

i would also suggest adding additional damage from flat pen items like sorcerer boots and lethality items

im interested if others would like to see this information let me know your thoughts

how is this possible i have 7 games in a row where each lane in our team is winning is this the matchmaking wanting me to win and placing me with other winners ive been stuck in emerald 4 for 23 weeks and because of this streak ive climbed up a division is this just pure coincidence is it because of jungle diff or something else ",Ranked Pressure
"basically riot is swapping from unique summoner names specific to league of legends to usernames with a tag across all of their games meaning that while in league of legends you used to have a username different from valorant a unique one too lets say mafiaqiqi now your username will look like mafiaqiqieuw1 across every riot games title

following this main change riot has announced the following adjustments

 name changes cannot be purchased with blue essence anymore they will be purchased using the relevant of 10 ingame currency with a free name change every year
 names will be global across all riot games

i personally believe this change is actually terrible and shouldnt happen due to the following reasons

 you no longer have the feeling of unique identity belonging to you if you thought of a unique funny username that you feel proud of everyone else may use it even in the same server
 your gaming identity is supposed to be a picture of how you would describe yourself in a fiction world by forcing users to select a tag you are limiting the way they can express themselves
 the fact that changing it in less than a year costs 10 following the samira overpriced skin the dark cosmic erasure jhin skin and some may say the redeemed star guardian xayah amp rakan shows that riot has been getting greedy minimal work for tons of profit and while yes this is how companies are supposed to work riot for as long as i remember hasnt been this way i felt like they showed a feeling of caring about players making affordable skins for as low as 400rp now while we still have access to epic skins it is shown that the newest of their choices specifically those that i said above show a feeling of greedyness at least the way i see it
 adding to the above i feel like it should be mentioned that this year riot invested the biggest budget compared to other years on league of legends
 blue essence will be completely useless for people that have unlocked every champion except for essence emporiumsby the time a new champion comes out those players would have plenty of be to buy the champion like 9 times

some argue that this is indeed a good change because

 2 or more people would be able to use the same username

this is true but this doesnt promote unique identities in the game world instead you are gonna see the same usernames on 30 of the games furthermore if someone mains zeri in league and puts a username like iamlightning or he just puts a funny username like alwaysdyingcarry he is gonna be forced to have the same username on valorant and other riot titles where the community there is likely to not get the joke furthermore seeing funny unique usernames gives me a smile most of the time however seeing alwaysdyingcarry username every 9 games makes the joke no longer funny

judging by the comments on their twitter post the majority of the community by far hates this change and i can see myself why however i wondered what reddit would think of this id appreciate if you could all state your opinion and reasoning below and i would be happy to read through most of the comments thank you if you decide to engage in the discussion

ampx200b

edit thank you all for your comments i have read most of them i was originally planning to respond to every single one however i really cant do so there are over 900 comments soon to be 1k i never expected it to be this much your views have given me insights both on how yall see your own username and on how yall perceive the games direction in the future

some points id like to address include the following i will probably keep editing the post with more updates based on what i read

many people are saying that this is not a serious change and the game is free2play etc yep i agree with that i will still keep playing the game after these name changes this post isnt a rant of some sort i simply felt like sharing my opinion and asking on how others perceive this change

if you care about your identity in a game you would not be changing it every x months  while this may be true there are still people who just like changing their ign including me i have used many joke usernames including alwaysdyingcarry hntaisenpai mafiaqiqi parentslost5050 ceo of racism ceo of oxygen and many others that i feel like will at least make a few  of players laugh changing it gives me that feeling of being different and also i make my friends laugh with them when we queue up it also gives me a reason to grind for blue essence while also giving a chance to another player to use them too

uniqueness doesnt matter its just a game lul games and identity no lul   according to some researchhttpswwwpsychologytodaycomintlblogbraintrust201512onlinegamesshowplayerpersonalityandhowchangeit your username and how you choose to play in an online world can hint at your personality and by compiling millions and millions of these data points the researchers point out that they can guess at psychological traits across global populations this is just the first result that came up from a google search if someone dedicades more time i am pretty sure he can find up more about this there are of course other factors in someone choosing a username however it is still your identity it is how you see yourself and want to be seen by fellow players it is something you chose other people to see you for

i dont care lol imagine caring about usernames  this is a post made so that i the op can get a better understanding of what the community thinks about this change if you have nothing to contribute to the discussion then simply stay quiet lol sometimes silence is just the better option i never once mentioned that this is a game changing change or that this will destroy league or anything along those lines i as mentioned above will still keep playing the game even if this change goes through",Bad Teammates

"in the swiss format you qualify to playoffs by going 30 31 or 32 and you get knocked out if you go 03 13 or 23 lets assume the most negative scenario for the west eastern

three western and three eastern teams at 22 if any western teams draw each other about 60 one is guaranteed top 8 in the other case east vs west east vs west and east vs west some of the best western teams at the tournament get three opportunities to

"picture this its 2 days to the end of the split and you que for a solo q game to grind towards your goal since you dont have much time left you get into a game everyone is stressed out a bit due to various reasons and you know its going to be a hard game game starts and the enemy invades and your adc dies and right then and there the game is over why because your adc is fully tilted and decides everyone should lose

awesome isnt it yeh its not

ampx200b

so why does this happen the majority of the people know that they will never become a pro player and not everyone wants to make a career out of this game either so this leaves out a handful of reasons that contributes to the stressful environment of ranked with one of them being the ranked rewards

ampx200b

ranked rewards are currently timegated and riot is reducing the time you have to grind ranked to get the skin  the chromas that show your achieved rank in the next split which is going to potentially increase the stress of climbing

ampx200b

basically you dont get your rank  you miss out on content that you might have a high interest in getting it which leads to toxicity and it usually gets worse around the end of each split which im sure most people have experienced it

ampx200b

enter ranked tokens

ampx200b

httpspreviewreddit1ly6di4znfub1pngwidth1280ampformatpngampautowebpampseeb2d83734c3f334ec24f17b769b4434023a88e2

what are ranked tokens they are currency that you get at the end of each split instead of a victorious skin they resemble the rank that you finished the split in with different colors and can be used to redeem a victorious skin or a chroma collection of your choice and if you pick the newest victorious skin it comes bundled with the chromas as well

ampx200b

httpspreviewreddits1fad313ofub1pngwidth3180ampformatpngampautowebpamps4e919798eec10be9ba4bdbd6f20814da2fdfb66a

the chroma bundle will get you all the chromas both solo q and flex for previous victorious skins up to your tokens color so even if you dont get the desired rank you can still try and climb to get that chroma of your choice and if you want to get the rest you have to grind again to get higher and spend another token

ampx200b

with such a system everyone will have a good reason to climb now sure the people that used to just play to get the skin will continue to do so but the rest of the community now has a incentive to try just a tiny little harder to get something that they might have missed due to various reasons and it will not timegate content that most can enjoy using

ampx200b

you missed out on a sejuani chroma because of x but now you have the time to grind well guess what you now have the opportunity to do so

ampx200b

with such a system the community isnt rushed to climb which can lower the toxicity overall and around certain times of the year and with the addition of 3 splits next year i think such a system would be way better than make the game a timesink where if you dont play it due to whatever reason you will miss out on a skin potentially for your onetrick which feels aweful",Bad Teammates

"what is the point of ranks nowadays if mmr is the only factor on matchmaking

ive seen this posted a couple of times on the sub but im genuinely curious what the consensus on ranks is at this point on the sub

been playing for a while and i understand why the matchmaking system was changed from visible mmr to visible ranks with hidden mmr to reduce ranked anxiety and people camping at mmr cutoffs but as far as i can tell visible rank always had an influence on hidden mmr up until recently where they made it so visible ranks are defacto useless 

personally i feel like in the spot that ranked is currently ranked anxiety can only have gotten worse than it ever was when visible mmr existed and i very much doubt cutoff camping has gone done significantly 

i mean if a new player loads into the game and sees the opponents he is going up against are 8001000lp above him whether or not their mmr is similar i just cant imagine he is going to be having a good time 

take this game for example  4 rank divisions in one ranked game httpspreviewreddit05a0pnbu5oub1jpgwidth736ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps040f7d4560adf6d669f3f66435bde4d5a5141ed4

i frequently see people sad about certain mages being pushed out of mid lane because of how the game of league has evolved makes me wonder why we dont see more bot lane apcs i think at this point seraphine and swain prove that its perfectly fine to do you dont really need an adc for objectives anymore since everyone deals so much damage and every role has champions with good single target or attack speed scaling why not take more mages into the bot lane role mages usually scale pretty nicely so why not put them in a place where they have a babysitter that can help them scale and a usually squishy and immobile adc to play around i think more than just seraphine swain and karthus will probably work,Game Balance

"the whole point of splits was because people reached their desired ranks in the start of the year and then camped them for the rest of the season so why not add ranked decay  the current diamond decay system would work perfectly in the ranks below higher elo is more strict basically you can have up to 28 banked days so 28 days that you can not play and perserve your rank every single game you play adds 7 days to that counter so you have to basically play 1 game per week or 4 games per month the decay would be 50lp per day if your banked days are over and you drop a maximum of 400lp numbers could vary and change obviously

that is pretty easy on the player even if they have a busy life morever in the end of each month reward players with something for being x rank so that there is motive to play throughout the whole year

3 ranked splits feels more like a chore to regain your old rank every time instead of a fun experience you are not going to be playing to climb higher or maintain your rank you will be playing to just get back to it not very exciting if you ask me

"role flexibility should not be reserved simply for leagues poster child champions 

as much as i meme around about the wind brothers being annoying to deal with im happy for them that they can play in different roles if they feel like it those players really like the champ and if they are sick of vsing sylas mid lane or darius top they can go bot and have a different experience  

riot is taking in feedback about the state of mages they are taking steps to balanceadjust champions like lux xerath and brand to be viable mid lane with buffs for that role while still taking into consideration their support impact neeko can play mid support and jungle her rework was praised as a successful example of making a champion more flexible and enjoyable because of the increased options she had wherever she wants to go

i find it baffling why riot wants to remove seraphine out of mid and bot lane when they are trying so hard to bring other mages back into other roles there are arguments to be made about adjusting the power level of seraphine bot but the intention to view it as an aberration worth deleting through her q nerfs rather than celebrated as a carrytype enchanter is sad champions should not be shoehorned to work specifically in one place when they already work in multiple 

i totally get that marksmen players want their own role bot aside from a very particular season i sincerely believe and see how riot is trying very hard to keep bot lane marksman favored apcs are niche but fit a unique role when all the other carries on the team are ad this flexibility should be preserved at the very least for strategic diversity 

i fear the balance team is going to double down even if her win rate bot lane is unviable because they will move to other projects i really worry riot will call it a day because lol shes a girlie girl and thats what support is for even though they specifically made champions like braum to counter that stereotype and there being so many cute support champs already 

seraphine should be able to carry in her own way in multiple roles like other champions if for no other reason than that she can already do so",Champion Design

"ive never seen the swiss format before so i decided to create a python script to simulate it i ran this simulation millions of times collecting data for analysis what ive found is quite interesting

a common narrative im hearing about swiss from people whove seen it in other esports is that if theres an upset things will get weird  

while its true its also missing something big the swiss stage does not need upsets to get weird

to prove this point i want to rank the teams and to remove my own bias we can use the outright betting odds from multiple sites and take the averages this is what it looks like



 rank  region  team  outright win odds 

 1     lpl     jdg   1445        
 2     lck     geng  4389        
 3     lpl     lng   5515        
 4     lck     t1    753         
 5     lpl     wbg   9083        
 6     lpl     blg   9333        
 7     lck     kt    1241        
 8     lck     dk    145         
 9     lec     g2    40553       
 10    lec     fnc   78333       
 11    lec     mad   88667       
 12    lcs     c9    98333       
 13    lcs     nrg   177777      
 14    lcs     tl    252777      
 15    lec     bds   275          
 16    vcs     gam   444444      

thankfully region distribution works out neatly the top 8 teams are from the lck and lpl and theres a bit of a gulf between dk rank 8 and g2 rank 9

lets define an upset as any rank 916 team beating a rank 1 to 8 team which is the same as saying an upset is an leclcsvcs team beating a lcklpl team

i ran the simulation while setting the chance of upsets to 0 and gave regions win rates heres a chart of it

 region 1  region 2  region 1 wr 

 lck       lck       50             
 lck       lpl       50             
 lck       lcs       100            
 lck       lec       100            
 lck       vcs       100            
 lpl       lpl       50             
 lpl       lcs       100            
 lpl       lec       100            
 lpl       vcs       100            
 lcs       lcs       50             
 lcs       lec       50             
 lcs       vcs       50             
 lec       lec       50             
 lec       vcs       50

 vcs       pi        50             


to summarise the chart if a 1 to 8th ranked team is playing a 9 to 16th ranked team they have a 100 win rate every other matchup is a 50 win rate 

now this is where things get juicy

i ran the simulation 100k times and these are the results

without ever beating an lck or lpl team 1 or more leclcsvcs teams advance in 62 of simulations

the real clever ones reading this probably have also realised that for this to be true lpllck teams will be going home without ever losing to anyone but lpllck teams

pretty cool for the west right bare in mind these stats above are an absolute minimum as clearly the western teams will have a better win rate against lpllck teams than 0 surely

if we compare swiss with the old groups format using the same seeding pools youll see how much better this format is for us 

with the old format using the same winrate method as above not a single leclcsvcs team will ever advance to quarters this is because each group will have an lck team and an lpl team and they will get 4 wins plus meanwhile this means the other 2 teams lose 4 each at a minimum

due to the increased randomness of swiss over the old groups stage and to the detriment of getting the true best 8 teams into the finals the west is definitely happy here should we feel bad that its very likely an lck  lpl team will drop out of the tournament by losing only to lck  lpl teams probably but hey it will be nice to win for once

i have more data using dummy team by team win rates trying to simulate closer to what will happen i got to these win rates by working backwards from the outright winning odds and trial and error with win rates until the output matched the outright perhaps ill go in depth of it thats for another post though here are some interesting things i learned bare in mind the accuracy relies on the quality of the input and its impossible to know the true odds before teams play

1 in swiss the average rank difference between teams in games is smaller than groups by approximately 11 meaning we get more competitive matches groups has far more completely one sided matchups

2 over 72 of scenarios had 2 or more leclcsvcs teams advancing

3  only 13 of scenarios had 0 leclcsvcs teams advancing so 987 had at least 1",Champion Design

gt overall our early indications of how 1320 has landed have been pretty positive players have been appreciating the slower paced games better fight pacing and reduced snowball out of the early game game time is up about a minute and back to where it was in season 78 snowballing is around the lowest level it has been in around 5 years
gt 
gt jungle jungle changes have landed reasonably well overall we think this helps reward junglers who are more efficient and weve been happy with seeing some of the initial movement on the balance of ganking and farming smite changes moved a lot here
gt 
gt however the withinrole champion balance is off some tanks are too strong and a lot of ad champions are too weak
gt 
gt were looking to return the ad ratio to the pet damage and do some more changes to the healing to move some more back to flat values
gt 
gt the jury is still out on whether the power of the role is in the right spot and well continue to monitor over the next few days for whatever followup adjustments are needed
gt 
gt ksante ksante shows some initial promising skew movement being better for average players and worse for pros were fixing a bunch of the bugs that have shown up buffing him up a bit and were continuing to monitor the feedback here
gt 
gt rammus hes just too strong with his heavy synergies with the resist buffs on the pet taking him down some
gt 
gt khazix belveth hecarim master yi these 4 junglers were disproportionately hurt by some of the changes a mix of objective value going down ad ratio removal from the pet blue pet nerf for hec belveth had additional movement from a set of direct changes looking to bring each up by some amount in addition to reverting the pet ad ratio nerf
gt 
gt other junglers tank junglers have moved up quite a bit which is unsurprising theyll go back down by some amount after the pet ad ratio is restored and well continue to monitor them after this
gt 
gt leblanc after the whole shiv saga is over and done with shes landed quite a lot weaker so were buffing her back up
gt 
gt aurelion sol scaling champions as a whole are a bunch stronger this patch and asol is one of the biggest movers were tapping him down some as a result
gt 
gt briar briar has the sharpest mastery curves ive ever seen working on league and its not close  people are getting to this point in the curve more reliably and so were taking her down some
gt 
gt caitlyn lethality cait has been pretty popular amongst higher ranked players for a long time its now getting to the point where its creeping into being her most powerful and popular builds lethality cait doesnt have the greatest gameplay its ok for her to have this build but it shouldnt be close to being the best way for her to play
gt 
gt dr mundo durability style patches tend to benefit mundo and this patch was no exception tapping him down some
gt 
gt jinx while we want jinx to have some amount of crazy unleashed feeling and having pop offs if she gets lots of takedowns near the enemy base as it gives her a unique thing from the roster t1 guma anyone this patch has gone a bit far were toning this aspect down but we still want this to be a strength of hers
gt 
gt runes were taking first strike down a bit more than it was before benefits disproportionately from longer games and phase rush is a bit strong after weve seen the other rune changes play out
gt 
gt hullbreaker finally we think hullbreaker is too sharp of an output and are looking to soften its outputs a bit while still keeping the item similarly powerful

"tldr gold should be displayed in game current champ power comparisons dont give good information and players get wrongly flamed for bad kda if theyre impacting the game well by other means estimating power levels without a gold display isnt fun skill expression and there would still be skill expression in comparing matchups and golditemslevels 

why hide stats to make it harder to tell whos actually winning the game currently we have to compare items look at cs and look at kda to tell roughly how much gold a player has and this still isnt the most accurate pro games already have gold display since its important to know whos likely stronger in fights this doesnt mean we should get rid of cs kda or item displays just show gold as well

 cs isnt a very good indicator of anything all it does is tell you roughly how well youve been playing your lane compared to your opponent or how close you are to optimal 10csm it gets especially worse when compared to jungle since camps dont track cs in a similar way this sometimes results in players flaming junglers or junglers flaming everyone else for misunderstanding how cs works
 tower plate gold is completely impossible to track unless theyve spent it on items if two laners cs are the same you might think theyre doing the same in lane but if one has gotten 4 plates theyre actually way stronger you can look at each turret pre14 minutes to see plates taken but after 14 minutes good luck
 comparing items is the biggest chore of all you have to look at each item compare to components compare to boots and compare the prices of items im not sure anyone can perfectly calculate gold from peoples inventories especially ingame when time is sensitive therefore its only a rough estimation of someones power especially since full items vary widely in price anywhere from 2100g to 3600g
 kda is the most stigmatized stat and probably the one most used to quickly check a players current power however its one of the worst indicators since assists vary a lot in the amount of gold they reward and shutdowns are all over the place ive often seen toplaners be 25 so my team underestimates them not realizing theyve gotten plates towers and lots of shutdown gold making them easily as strong as the 105 adc kda is also the root of lots of flame from even experienced players misunderstanding the impact a player has on a game 
 say what you want about thebausffs but hes a good example of how kda doesnt always translate to game impact hes a multiyear challenger players whos gotten rank 1 before with a unique playstyle of trading his life for perfect cs tower plates towers and tower damage hell often have lots of deaths and very negative kda but still be the most fed player in the game
 shutdowns objective bounties and laners taking random jungle camps makes gold even harder to track why be forced to estimate it all the time why not just give this type of information

the only argument i can see in favor of keeping a gold display out of the game is skill expression but to those who feel that way i ask is estimating gold amounts a fun way to express your skill there are already a million fun skill expressive aspects of league like champion mastery item builds macro strategy game knowledge etc if gold was displayed youd still have to estimate a players actual champion strength relative to yours can a 5000g level 13 jax beat a 6500g level 12 master yi youd still have to compare levels items especially defensive items and champion matchups in my opinion hiding those gold values doesnt make this power comparison any more interesting in fact i believe displaying gold will open up the playerbase to more diverse strategies for getting ahead in game saving them from getting wrongly flamed for having a bad kda if theyre impacting the game well by other means",Game Balance

note jungle pet ad scaling was removed 10 to 0 ap scaling 12 to 10 and armormr scaling buffed 10 to 20 the pet damage is significant because it is aoe damage and greatly improves clear speed

httpswwwopggchampionsregionnaamptieremerald_plusamppositionjungle the top 11 junglers by opggs metrics are currently fiddlesticks briar graves rammus lillia ekko j4 zac ivern evelyn maokai

the highest absolute wr junglers are fiddlesticks and rammus with 54 wr this is a ludicrous wr and junglers with 54 tend to get nerfed next patch or hotfixed

as of now the top 11 junglers are all ap except for briarj4 who are both ludicrously overtuned balls of stats and because j4 only needs level 23 to be relevant also note that j4 has been broken for the entire year hitting 54 after goredrinkershojin buffs then receiving nerfs and graves because he has aoe and pet damage scales with armor which he stacks using his e true grit stacks during clears

notably rammus is fucking stupid with the new changes because not only does he build a thornmail first pet aoe dmg scales off 20 armor stacking but his kit makes passivew do damage scaling with armor so he builds full armor and clears faster than a full ad jungler building only damage with no downside

as of 1320 apcarry junglers have the fastest clear

but stupidly tank junglers also clear faster than addamage junglers now before there was a tradeoff to pick a tank vs picking an addamage jungler generally tank junglers clear slower because they have much stronger teamfighting and cc for ganks now they have greatly buffed the armormr scaling of the pets to the point that tank junglers actually clear the same speed if not faster than ad damage junglers so they not only clear faster but they have better ganks cc and teamfighting so there isnt any point to pick addamage junglers anymore and the stats reflect this

"picture this its 2 days to the end of the split and you que for a solo q game to grind towards your goal since you dont have much time left you get into a game everyone is stressed out a bit due to various reasons and you know its going to be a hard game game starts and the enemy invades and your adc dies and right then and there the game is over why because your adc is fully tilted and decides everyone should lose

awesome isnt it yeh its not

ampx200b

so why does this happen the majority of the people know that they will never become a pro player and not everyone wants to make a career out of this game either so this leaves out a handful of reasons that contributes to the stressful environment of ranked with one of them being the ranked rewards

ampx200b

ranked rewards are currently timegated and riot is reducing the time you have to grind ranked to get the skin  the chromas that show your achieved rank in the next split which is going to potentially increase the stress of climbing

ampx200b

basically you dont get your rank  you miss out on content that you might have a high interest in getting it which leads to toxicity and it usually gets worse around the end of each split which im sure most people have experienced it

what are ranked tokens they are currency that you get at the end of each split instead of a victorious skin they resemble the rank that you finished the split in with different colors and can be used to redeem a victorious skin or a chroma collection of your choice and if you pick the newest victorious skin it comes bundled with the chromas as well

ampx200b

httpspreviewreddits1fad313ofub1pngwidth3180ampformatpngampautowebpamps4e919798eec10be9ba4bdbd6f20814da2fdfb66a

the chroma bundle will get you all the chromas both solo q and flex for previous victorious skins up to your tokens color so even if you dont get the desired rank you can still try and climb to get that chroma of your choice and if you want to get the rest you have to grind again to get higher and spend another token

ampx200b

with such a system everyone will have a good reason to climb now sure the people that used to just play to get the skin will continue to do so but the rest of the community now has a incentive to try just a tiny little harder to get something that they might have missed due to various reasons and it will not timegate content that most can enjoy using

ampx200b

you missed out on a sejuani chroma because of x but now you have the time to grind well guess what you now have the opportunity to do so

ampx200b

with such a system the community isnt rushed to climb which can lower the toxicity overall and around certain times of the year and with the addition of 3 splits next year i think such a system would be way better than make the game a timesink where if you dont play it due to whatever reason you will miss out on a skin potentially for your onetrick which feels aweful",Bad Teammates
"kayn

  kayn already has an indicator for his e but it shows only either his full duration length or the reduced length while there is already an audio cue thats played when his e runs out due to not being in a wall i think a visual clarification via an indicator could also help

 i think similarly an outofchampioncombatindicator could help so that you arent suprised when you directly exit the wall  maybe for this and the previous point there could also be an elegant solution which i dont see

ampx200b

 on the vision of e i feel lt is unintuitive for enemies that he just has a vision radius around him when inside a wall and can thus see over other walls he isnt inside off i dont think you can see his shadowball inside the wall through fow so the enemies dont know that he sees them either walls could proberly block vision or the enemies could be notified wth eyes over their head

ampx200b

  expanding on the point of vision in e it can be confusing for kayn himself to understand that he doesnt get vision in bushes during e same for zoe ult  normaly bushes you dont have vision of throw a shadow onto themselfes however since for kaynzoe during er bushes dont throw a shadow it looks as if you have vision inside even though you dont  i understand that at least for kayn if bushes would throw shadows his vision inside some walls would get severely nerfed  but one could also try to implement that the bushes dont apear as bright

"i am pretty new to league played a lot of norms over the past few months been getting a lot better lately decided to finally try ranked thinking itll just be iron or bronze and cant be too bad 

first game almost an entire lobby of platinum players second game same story to say i experienced toxicity would be an understatement but i completely understand why i had no business being in a lobby with these players and they were understandably frustrated with me

i understand that most games need a few matches to determine your skill level and put you in an appropriate rank but most games will start you low and then work you up from there if you do well

this was the most miserable hour of league ive experienced and makes me not even want to try ranked again mostly just came here to vent but also to ask if this is normal and why the game does it this way

edit getting a lot of plat isnt high elo anymore responses i appreciate the info but thats beside the point its higher than iron bronze silver and gold and seems an odd place to start someone in their very first ranked game",Bad Teammates

"hi

this is not a post asking for buffs this is a sequel to the quick thoughts on irelia in the patch 1318 retrospective timestamped here httpsyoutube5scaaogn8nmt1134httpsyoutube5scaaogn8nmt1134 

ampx200b

quick summary 

 phreak talked about how irelia is tied to bork how it would be nice to fix this but its no small change hes 100 right
 ive interviewed a number of masters irelia mains amp otps and put together a consolidated set of suggestions to help with this 
 im only emerald 3 myself so i spent more time just listening and aggregating the thoughts of other experienced high elo players in one place 
 this should also improve sentiment laning against her as an ancillary side effect 

ampx200b

why is bork so strong on her at a systematic level boring stuff here skip this

 her actual ad ratios are quite weak 20 ad ratio on passive 60 ad ratio on q damage 13 ad heal ratio thats basically it not counting w 
 instead her scaling works like this innately she has a lot of attack speed some magic damage on hit and q applies lifesteal  onhit effects
 bork giving her all 3 of those things lifesteal onhit attack speed makes it mandatory and essential to function 
 the hp shred allows her to combat health stackers but is actually fiercely strong into squishy champs as well
 the fact that bork can slow too helps her land her e which is icing on top 
 lesson 1 of irelia is always if you dont buy bork first every single game youre trolling

ampx200b

goals feel free to skip bullets

1 irelias general power is not exclusive to bork

 she can explore other items first without literally trolling she is not a walking bork who dashes around
 currently when bork is strong irelia is strong when bork is weak irelia is weak can cause lots of frustration for both her and opponents
 riot can safely change items however they wish and irelia will not suddenly become op or unplayable and remains stable relative to her light fighter cohorts
 current model of irelias damage and gold scaling is overwhelmingly through onhit items bork and to a lesser extent wits end this is why youll notice she dramatically falls off past the point of obtaining those two items
 people playing against irelia will no longer feel like she is full build at bork and dont have to constantly check her items between 812 minutes out of sheer paranoia she suddenly became thanos

2 top lane is more emphasized as her primary role

 she can play more like a fighter her actual role and less like an assassin long standing meta adaptation 
 this was intended by the original 2018 full rework
 she can of course still kill squishies but this shouldnt be an effortless affair at 1 item were advocating for this being more realistic somewhere in the 2 to 3 item range 
 the irelia fantasy is about kiting enemies through a wave with her very long 200 aa range using q resets on minions and autos on her enemies to dance around shes a blade dancer after all
 assassin irelia game pattern can be something as plain as just q  e1 hide it on minion e2 champion gt q  aa q  aa aa aa aa until dead this executes pretty quickly and resembles an akali allin instead of extended combat like a fighter
 she will have a closer power band to her other horsewomen cohorts who are also light fighter carries
 currently her ability to 1v1 at 3 items on even footing is among the worst of all champions who need to function as duelists and have power budget invested in sidelaning cam fiora riven gwen and yone all considerably outperform her at 3 items on even footing against other top lane champs she will be comparably worse at oneshotting at 1 item however which is more suited to top lane naturally having slightly delayed impact

ampx200b

what shouldnt change free to skip past first bullet

 she doesnt need her overall winrate buffed
 her buttons should still all feel the same her kit is amazing fun and needs no changes
 her w and e should deal the exact same damage q should ideally deal more or less the same minion damage irelia players have all the breakpoints memorized for softening up minions to enable resets this is essential to playing her well and distinguishes the players skill we dont want to force players to relearn the breakpoints from the ground up
 she should not be a universally safe top lane blind pick and should have her fair share of uphill battles like camfiorivengwen has for instance youll notice even a great irelia player and someone who would play her to death back in the day like tf blade has become incredibly stingy with the times he picks her more than ever before irelking predominantly plays her midlane now and has for a while
 teamfighting potency remains the same
 she still remains a fighterdiver and will look to engage on a target and deal as much damage as she can 
 she still fights her way out or dies trying as she does now she does not have much ability to escape  thats intended 

ampx200b

suggestions for accomplishing these goals

1 q does not apply onhits from items

 retains the bonus of 4 stacks magic damage when cast to keep her passive management important
 the damage it deals can now scale more from the ad ratio
 scaling generically off ad lets her consider many different items she can also scale more smoothly and less spikey
 the healing is now less about stacking lifesteal through items and can scale more from the ad ratio
 q can have the hybrid damage profile for fighting tankier targets now more shifted into her passive with a better ratio and less from specific mustbuy items
 hp magic damage is now gone from items and can just be shifted into q we highly recommend having this come online when she is already at 4 stacks to require irelia to land her abilities this is both what makes her fun distinguishes play skill and also help solve the problem of she missed everything and 1 shot me with autos

2 consider reverting the patch 1216 buff to base mr make it 28 instead of 30

 followup option to further disincentivize mid lane if needed 

ampx200b

fun facts more boring stuff feel free to skip 

1 irelia was not intended to be snowball reliant like she is now riots thoughts on this from the designers

2 her kit is very reliable which leads to uninteresting stat checks and makes her more snowball reliant than she should be 2018 rework sought to repair that  
httpsnexusleagueoflegendscomenus201710championroadmapoctober2017httpsnexusleagueoflegendscomenus201710championroadmapoctober2017

3 keep in mind to further deemphasize the snowball reliance they nerfed her early game power considerably in the change from 5 stack to 4 this was a step in the right direction and it definitely helped we just need to continue progressing down that path  read here

closing thoughts

irelias pick rate peaked at 14 near s12s start and now is a notch above 7 which is a notable decrease given her popularity if youre a diehard top lane irelia otp some games you will be zoned off the first 34 waves of minions by darius sett volibear whatever thats fine the 2021 mini rework made this the case and any irelia otp knows how to play this patiently what doesnt feel right is being behind against that bully champ archetype getting your bork around 11 minutes assuming things didnt go to shit and herald might not be up and plates dont fall for another 3 minutes youre at the strongest youll ever be and theres not much opportunity to make it count if the enemy is both favored in the 1v1 and ahead in items meanwhile you need to be mindful of defending lane this wont be the case every game but it can be extremely frustrating to experience sorry but if im zoned off 4 waves by darius where he bases for longsword  cloth armor and im forced to rebound into him irelia deserves a better carrot on the end of the stick than well heres your bork bro make it count or forever be a worse yonecamfioragwenriven insert melee light fighter carry champ here

the changes above with the right tunings would likely solve this problem dedicated irelia players want to play irelia and not be a walking bork this aligns closely with riots preseason goal of removing mythics to emphasize the power and abilities innate to the champions and not be league of items as the meme goes

ampx200b

tldr  if irelia q does not apply onhit from items such as bork 100 bork reliance is gone and future power budget is no longer held hostage the actual specific numerical iteration will take some careful tuning and followup work from a game designer  balancer

answer yourself honestly how often do you really pay attention to the summoner names of other players or even use them to communicate instead of adressing them by the name of their champion

from my experience 99 of the time people use champion names or dont communcate at all and the last time i saw someone pay attention to a clever joke or refference in someones name was probably during season 4

not to mention that there are a lot of player who never cared about their summoner names anway and simply used a gibbersish of letters and numbers or generic words just to have a name and play the game

additionally lols playerbase is so huge that running into someone with the same name as yours or someone elses is going to border on a miracle unless youre playing in masters and above where player count gets really low

there is also the topic of impersonation and use of names of people popular in the lol community but that has been happening for years through use of special characters and other tricks so not much is going to change there has been a very small handful of instances of me playing aginst or with someone who i thought could be a youtuber only to find out that theyre some kid who barely speaks english and knows the most colorful combinations of racial slures in the world

 there is the prospect of people who got their desired name joinked being able to finally use them and this is also potentially going to put rest to name reselling

"first of all i would like to note that i will try to be as respectful as possible in this extra long list of complaints that will be presented below complaints that not only i have but also other members of the league of legends player community have mentioned in a previous post i made on the league pbe reddit

at the beginning of this year riot mentioned that this would be its year with the biggest budget of all previous years which seemed to indicate that as players we could expect to get improvements incredible changes to the game and also to the champions that make it up

ampx200b

it didnt happen at any time

ampx200b

as a lan server player im grateful that the widespread toxicity that has been in the game for years is finally being addressed and this issue is being taken more seriously but in other things we feel really insulted and not taken into account

i will go on to comment on the topic regarding the skins of the champions which is a quite controversial topic and more so since these last two years which are 2022 and 2023 as i mentioned previously in that post on the league pbe reddit many of us have been able to see how ahri miss fortune or even lux receive beautiful skins with incredible visual effects and beautiful recalls however other champions do not receive the same treatment and the vast majority are forgotten characters such as samira yorick taliyah syndra seraphine orianna nami xayah and rakan have been treated very unfairly with respect to the latter aspects that have been brought out for them

about 10 days ago riot brightmoon mentioned that some of the main syndras harassed them insulted them and even threatened them because of how coven syndra looked in the game due to that reaction they solved the problem and yesterday the new aspect in the game was revealed

the star guardian line skin pack from wild rift to pc with seraphine and orianna arrived with visible glitches sg seraphine was missing many of her movement transition animations she doesnt do the animation that she is supposed to transition into her walking animation and she also automatically attacks something while she walks

sg orianna problems with her model and some animations and they did not remove the robot filter the effects of sg taliyahs abilities are horrendous coven nami is supposed to be a legendary skin and they made no effort to change the details on her skin not to mention yoricks hat and even less the appearance that would be samiras ultimate skin and jhin selling a chroma for 200 seems a bit low to me

lets move on to xayah and rakan who have been the most outraged champion pairing lately when the star guardians skin corrupted version of them came out it was requested if riot could at least release a chroma of them prior to the corruption because it came out as the skins looked and everyone loved it and the excuse was that there wasnt enough budget available to do such an action when the arcana and broken covenant skins came out riot brightmoon himself mentioned that future skins of the pair would no longer have a unique special recall and that the base recall would remain their excuse was that a limited number of players shared the same aspect for both champions or that the number of people who played them were minimal

recently with the release of their redeemed versions of star guardians they are nothing more and nothing less than a copy and paste of the code of their corrupt versions they only applied recolor and nothing else needless to say about their lines in the game xayah and rakan are supposed to be warmer in their redeemed versions and listening to them is like listening to their corrupted versions

so that makes me wonder why create threads here on reddit requesting comments and constructive criticism to improve aspects if they dont take them into account as much as we requested that corresponding changes be made in every aspect we simply remained silent every champion deserves the same treatment that the most popular champions receive

and now moving on to the game itself many champions are having problems when executing their skill sets an example of this is that diana has a bug since last season where her passive 3rd aa is delayed to the 4th aa for two days now the rift map has been having problems the ground is disappearing plants appear in places where they shouldnt be champions can go through rocks tryndamere and illaoi presenting constant bugs someone mentioned that aram is also showing cracks in its map

with so many problems in the game not only with the skins but with the champions and maps in the game it makes me wonder where was that bigger budget for this year

the game is falling apart and it doesnt seem important and despite the complaints criticisms and comments that can help them see how they could improve it in all aspects they decide to maintain absolute silence this makes them show that they dont care about their players they dont care about their players opinions they will simply do what they want because they are used to people paying for mediocre things

i swear that no one wants to insult you or threaten you but it seems that it is the only way in which you listen to us in the most violent and aggressive way and that is making riot set a dangerous precedent because they only listen through threats

please dont forget that you are the company you are today thanks to your community of players",Toxicity from Others
"its very simple communication 

everyone knows that moment when youre on discord with the boys and do random stuff shtting on each other in a good sense talking about nongame related stuff and others

the same invironment has to be in lol play to relax

communication helps to actually enjoy this hell of a game

i hope riot introduces voice chat to the whole team in lol so people can organize their plays or talk tense situations out

someone has beef with someelse this happens in ervy gmae tho so just mute

the toxicity is lol is inlack of those moments where people actually talk in every 2nd game the whole chat is quiet and the game becomes bland and forgettable but when people flame each other or compliment each other the game is special and actual fun",Bad Teammates
"hullbreaker is currently breaking most elos and it needs to be addressed imo

nobody likes facing hullbreaker nobody likes playing with hullbreaker even the people who are abusing it probably dont like it and would split anyway it is the most game defining item in the entire roster more so than any mythic could even dream of being it promotes a boring toxic and shallow play style for all 10 players and requires the enemy team to play much much better than the hullbreaker team to stand a chance 

you can argue all the points for gives toplane agency reward for weakside or against ridiculous gold efficiency ridiculous winrates toxic playstyle but it doesnt matter it absolutely destroys the league experience for everyone involved

this got 10 times worse with the snowball reductions so it is so much harder to punish interested to read some other opinions because as a bot side player it feels impossible to win if enemy toplaner wins and builds that item",Bad Teammates

"im a pretty casual league of legends player playing on euw hit platinum 1 at peak and i play the game every once in a while in ranked solo queue for me i always pick either top or mid as my 1st and 2nd priority as it is the only roles i really know how to play and also have fun playing

ampx200b

every 2nd game i queue midlane i always get autofilled into a position i have no interest in playing that being mostly jungle as it is a insanely difficult role for me to manage my lanes while simutaniously being aware of my opponents its a hard role that not everyone can get into easily in those games that i get filled into positions i dont main i always perform badly this of course leads to my team getting frustrated by me which is understandable cause who wants to lose lp over something thats out of controll making the game less fun for everyone

also if everyone gets the option to pick 2 different roles why would someone then need to get put into a role someone else probably has as 2nd option making the 2nd role preference be completely useless

ampx200b

if lol is such a competitive game as it is shouldnt everyone be allowed to play in a environment of their choosing

ampx200b

a game on average takes 2035 minutes which is at least at my rank platinum way longer a time than it wouldve took me to queue into a game which usually takes about 12 minutes so why force someone into a game of which they are most likely not going to have fun it just leads to more toxicity and as we all know league of legends is already famous for that

ampx200b

i understand how autofill can help with queue times but if you want to get into a game quickly then because you might not have much time to play there is a option in the queue menu called fill that you can use

but what if you dont mind playing other positions but still mainly want your main position thats why i think autofill should be a setting that the player can decide on to have enabled or disabled

tldr players not being allowed into a position of their choosing is hurting the game because it leads to toxicity

"so this item used to give 80 ap 50 as and 20 cdr they changed it in season 11 to be 100 ap and 50 as 

having it be this allows kaisa to get w upgrade on one item and then skip out on it meaning she doesnt have to really go into ap at all in order to get her w to upgrade she kinda just picks it up on the way to building more ad items so instead of her having to do a full hybrid build with at least 2 ap items and 3 ad items and then boots she goes 1 ap and 4 ad 

giving it cdr would also push it back onto other champs that could really benefit from it like mordekaiser kaisa of course has been going through balance issues as of late with her absolutely insane pick rate and builds changing every month while still remaining meta but i think this is one of the more build global problems she has with her kit imagine if she could be building ap full and build just 1 ad item like a ravenous hydra or something get her q upgrade and then just build full ap and get her q upgrade still this would be the same type of problem

right now theres the umbral duskblade nashors build going on and of course its gonna result in her getting nerfed again but if this specific problem doesnt exist my guess is shell just move onto the next ad item that fits her best while still only building 1 ap item for w upgrade",Champion Design

now just to get it out of the way the entirety of tes could count for this but you probably already know them tian rookie jkl so im just not gonna mention them beyond this some of edg too

now the two big names that i feel have to be mentioned are

shanji omg

i noticed that there were a lot of omg fans on the english side of lpl this year and a lot of that has to be thanks to this guy and also ppgod lmao the entire omg roster had a unique and fun playstyle that wasnt scared to go in and make plays that could turn games shanji is kind of the embodiment of that and his rumble is something to behold

its not really certain what will happen to this omg roster next year as they probably cant afford to keep everyone so look out for shanji joining a top team and making his debut next year

photic nip

now although nip hasnt been the same since pretty much everyone else but photic left he definitely still remains a bright spot not just on the team but in the entire lpl the mechanics are there the carry mindset is there  its just baffling why he decided to ask for zhuo over ppgod as his support but regardless i am pretty confident he will get a chance to shine at some point in his career at worlds

there are a few more people as well but its hard to say for sure what their future is

xhr  super hyped up as the next jungle superstar barely got any playing time

yskm  went absolute theshyesque sicko mode to start his time in lpl fizzled out really fast still has time to prove himself

shanks  was previously also really hyped up but maybe proven not to be as good as thought looking lately like he might turn that around though",Bad Teammates
"think about it old league rewarded farming much more than new league did for example if you splitpushed at 1516 minutes in the game while everybody else was fighting for no objective aram midlane you pushed a wave into a camp that was killed in 3seconds doing no dmg to you into the next sidelane wave into a enemy camp into a recall   
and today the camp will kill you at 15minutes or half hp you down while forcing you to waste 15seconds on it or ur entire mana just before you can push out the next wave and if a fight happened  near by well now you feel bad because you lost all ur hp to fight   


so now ur telling urself skip the camp just push the wave well now you only got 2 waves worth of value and have to wait another 30seconds for the next minion wave while ur entire team probably got aced 5v4 meanwhile great good payoff   
honestly this might be just the biggest reason why splitpushing is so much worse nowadays compared to the past and feels so unrewarding today  


in the past players got punished who burgerflipped midlane aramfights over and over with no clear outcome between the two teams because you did this splitpush strat 3 times in a row and now all of a sudden you had massive expgold lead vs everybody else   
but today this is just not the case anymore or is it",Bad Teammates

hello fellow summoners

today i bring forth a champion concept that brews in the cauldron of my creativity vaylyn the rift walker  a wanderer of realms master of magnetic forces and a formidable fighter in the rift 

weapon mechanics

vaylyns weapon isnt bound by a single form but harnesses the potential to morph into diverse manifestations each catering to a distinct style of combat and strategic utilization

 form one unchanged a solitary shard in hand while others orbit her unleashing short to medium range ranged assaults
 form two bastard sword the fragments unite into a colossal blade facilitating melee combat and rapid agile movements
 form three bow half the shards morph into a bow releasing others as arrowlike projectiles reappearing after a brief hiatus facilitating medium to longrange combat
 form four combined the shards meld with vaylyn empowering her with bursts of vehement magic and intensified magnetic capabilities

each form encapsulates a different facet of combat and strategy providing vaylyn with the flexibility to adapt to various battlefield scenarios and opponent strategies thereby crafting a multifaceted gameplay experience

conceptual design

while the fragmented shapeshifting weapon forms the core of vaylyns conceptual design its her ability to seamlessly traverse through the rift coupled with the magnetic manipulation of her weapon that makes her stand out her lore could potentially weave through shattered dimensions exploring tales of loss survival and indomitable willpower thereby weaving her into the rich tapestry of the league of legends universe  


ampx200b



wanted to share my idea for awhile now so im eager to hear feed back  


  


 

 vaylyn the rift maiden

lore

originating from the ethereal rifts between dimensions vaylyn is a testament to the duality of existence having wandered countless dimensions shes familiar with the balance and imbalances that existence entails her hair  half black and half white  serves as a visual testament to her origin the juxtaposition of light and shadow her striking yellow eyes are a manifestation of the rifts shes traveled each one containing a universe of stories the tattered black tunic leather pants and shoulder cape are souvenirs from the battles shes waged across realms her blade unlike any other is an embodiment of the fragmented dimensions held together by the magnetic energy from the core of the rifts

appearance

 hair half black and half white cascading down in a chaotic dance of duality
 eyes intense yellow containing depth and tales of countless realms
 outfit a tattered black tunic brown leather pants tall boots that have seen much wear and a flowing shoulder cape reminiscent of the shifting sands of time
 weapon a single blade made of fragmented shimmering pieces it pulses with the magnetic energy each fragment representing the different realms vaylyn has visited

abilities

passive  dual existence vaylyns basic attacks and abilities have a dual effect influenced by the current form of her blade

1 q  dimensional strike  


 unchanged vaylyn sends out a volley of shards targeting enemies in a cone dealing damage and slowing them
 bastard sword vaylyn slashes through enemies in front of her dealing damage and reducing their armor
 bow fires a charged shard arrow that pierces through enemies dealing damage over time
 combined releases a pulse of magnetic energy repelling enemies around her and dealing magic damage

1 w  rift dash  


 unchanged dashes a short distance leaving behind a trail of shards that damage enemies
 bastard sword charges forward dealing damage to the first enemy hit and knocking them back
 bow leaps backwards creating distance and dropping magnetic mines that slow enemies
 combined dashes to a target immobilizing them with magnetic force

1 e  magnetize  


 unchanged magnetizes the ground in an area rooting enemies for a short duration
 bastard sword swings the sword in a wide arc pulling enemies toward her
 bow shoots a magnetic arrow that draws enemies together upon impact
 combined surrounds herself with a magnetic shield absorbing a portion of incoming damage

1 r ultimate  shifting essence  
vaylyn channels the power of the rifts changing the form of her blade activating the ultimate allows vaylyn to cycle through the four forms of her weapon each granting her different abilities and altering her playstyle

gameplay style

vaylyns versatility is her greatest strength depending on the state of the game and the needs of her team she can adapt to various situations in the lane her unchanged and bow forms allow for harassment and poke while her bastard sword form is excellent for allins and trades the combined form is ideal for team fights where her burst of magic can turn the tide of battle

however this adaptability also requires a high skill ceiling mastering vaylyn means understanding when to shift between weapon forms optimizing her abilities in various combat scenarios

quotes

 on selection the rifts beckon and i answer
 movement every step is a journey between realms
 attacking feel the power of the rifts
 joke why did i cross the rift to get to the other dimension

"for t1

hi everyone

i dont normally make these posts but just wanted to share how i feel about the upcoming worlds 2023 as a long time t1 fan

ive watched t1 play since their 2013 debut and have cheered the team on ever since ive been heavily invested in the ups and downs of the team and for the past 2 years its been rough 

the current t1 roster for some reason makes me so emotionally invested despite their potential theyve fell short from earning any international titles

that being said watching the individual videos of t1 players expectations and thoughts on the upcoming championship truly makes me sad it really does feel like regardless of the outcome we will see a change to this roster

all in all i truly wish the best for this team and i will send them my energy for every game of this tournament i know they can be the protagonist for this tournament and truly represent what deft has sad about unbreakable will

"riot has nerfed zed with the 1320 w cooldown from 2014 to 2017 seconds following the patch 1223 nerf to his q and e damage and 122 nerf to his r damage the results is as follows

in emerald zed now has a winrate of 4816 which is the 5th worst midlaner by wr in his main role

prior to the nerf a lot of people were complaining how as a high skill champion he should have a low winrate well congratulations he now has a lower winrate than the likes of akali and irelia despite having a incredibly safe laning phase according to some

the champion is so poor at getting early leads that onzed has opted out of electrocute ignite even against squishy champions like zerath and jayce saying that he has no kill pressure so taking ignite simply puts him behind compared to tp

despite this zed still maintains a 362 banrate which is perplexing since many here claim zeds high banrate is due to the champion being op obviously its not the reason since even at his worst state in years he still has the 2nd highest banrate in the game

zed at full build that still needs to land 3 skillshots to kill a squishy got another nerf when lethality caitlyn can 1 headshot a talon but apparently thats ok while assassins should not be able to kill with full combo yall know jack shit about balancing

edit honestly i can understand if you just dont like him hell i prefer when hes good with lethality instead of hydra just dont try to cope and say hes overpowered cuz he just isnt",Champion Design

"just came back to league big mistake and the game is at is worst state in my opinion im at emerald and my peak was diamond iii in season 7 or 6 so i think i can get there again

the problem is the number of feeders and ppl that give up on the early game is huge never seen the game like this before just had a fiora going 211 and feeding the fuck out of enemy topnaner before i was done with my first camps and thats commom as fuck people lose de early game and start to soft int or type ff15 and shit

i know that its normal to have one or another bad game but nowadays the number of fucked up games if huge before i feel like ppl wanted to win more

dude started to running it down and that was it

i ended the game 113 and was actually the most frsutrating experience i had since i came back 

after ganking the dude a couple times i said i was going to help bot lane cause he toplaner was uselless already

result i got chat restricted and cant play ranked for 5 games and nothing happened to the dude that was running it down to enemy base

"theres always a lot of talk that even with 4 seeds lpl and lck have a lot of deserving talent that fails to make it onto the big stage every year that is 100 true and today i want to shine a light on some of the players that maybe you will see at worlds in the next couple years

now just to get it out of the way the entirety of tes could count for this but you probably already know them tian rookie jkl so im just not gonna mention them beyond this some of edg too

now the two big names that i feel have to be mentioned are

shanji omg

i noticed that there were a lot of omg fans on the english side of lpl this year and a lot of that has to be thanks to this guy and also ppgod lmao the entire omg roster had a unique and fun playstyle that wasnt scared to go in and make plays that could turn games shanji is kind of the embodiment of that and his rumble is something to behold

its not really certain what will happen to this omg roster next year as they probably cant afford to keep everyone so look out for shanji joining a top team and making his debut next year

photic nip

now although nip hasnt been the same since pretty much everyone else but photic left he definitely still remains a bright spot not just on the team but in the entire lpl the mechanics are there the carry mindset is there  its just baffling why he decided to ask for zhuo over ppgod as his support but regardless i am pretty confident he will get a chance to shine at some point in his career at worlds

there are a few more people as well but its hard to say for sure what their future is

xhr  super hyped up as the next jungle superstar barely got any playing time

yskm  went absolute theshyesque sicko mode to start his time in lpl fizzled out really fast still has time to prove himself

shanks  was previously also really hyped up but maybe proven not to be as good as thought looking lately like he might turn that around though",Bad Teammates

"everyone is talking about communication in league lately with the removal of even more pings it seems like league has become more lonely as some have stated but there is also one thing that might be overlooked that causes the loneliness and its the chat

i feel like constant parroting of just muteall to climb bro over the years while genuine shortterm advice has led to this culture of decreased communication in league of legends yes not being able to see the toxicity in chat can help you to focus more on the game but is this really healthy longterm everyone following advice such as this especially in ranked feeds into the lonely factor

i feel like with leagues new toxicity detection in chat more players should be encouraged to participate because toxic behavior in chat can be punished way more easily toxicity from chat messages is easy to detect and ban meanwhile soft inting and ping abusing is not meaning more of those toxic players would be filtered out over time

without the chat in muteall culture people are more likely to express their toxicity through soft inting and get away with it because it is so hard to detect allowing these players to type and get banned would help in the long run to filter out actual detectable toxic behavior  


solution in a 5v5 competitive game with no voice chat such as league i feel like the option to deafen your entire team should not be allowed players who are abusive in chat should be reported and banned accordingly but meaningful chat interaction between players is crucial not only for strategy but also to fix many of the systemic issues in league that makes the community feel so isolated",Bad Teammates
"given im a big numbers guy i made a spreadsheet to simulate the entirety of the worlds 2023 swiss stage about a week ago which i posted on githubhttpsgithubcomchiefdelphi7lol2023swisspredictions now that we have seen the worlds draw and the firstround matchups i wanted to dive a bit deeper into the draws impact who won who lost and how much firstround draws actually impact a teams chances of advancing through the tournament 



i already made a post describing the methodology of the simulation httpswwwredditcomrleagueoflegendscomments172emn0interactive_worlds_2023_swiss_stage_predictor but the crux of the rating system is that every team gets a power score that the user can adjust based on personal opinions and biases the probability team a beats team b is powerteam a  powerteam a  powerteam b its a simple system but its been shown to work reasonably well and quickly in practice in a number of contexts i tried to give what i thought was a fair assessment of teams relative powers east gt west gt minor regions higher seeds generally  higher power score but again if you can disagree you can adjust stuff yourself however nearly all of the conclusions i draw below are independent of the exact power values for each team all we care about is the order of teams and the strong east  west imbalance



if you saw the draft and agreed that generally east gt west you would come to the pretty obvious conclusion that c9 and mad were big winners kt and blg were big losers and the rest of the west were small losers for losing out on a chance to dodge the east the data generally supports this but the margins of impact are smaller than what i had expected

3 biggest absolute winners

1 c9 advancement odds 314 gt 353 39
2 gen advancement odds 906 gt 933 27
3 t1 advancement odds 850 gt 876  26

honorary mentions jdg 23 wbg 22 mad 20

however this is a tad biased against the west as were measuring odds improvement in absolute terms when most people think of improving the odds they think of improving odds relative to their original values ex twice as likely 


when you take this into account the biggest winners by relative odds improvement are

1 c9 1249 more likely to advance
2 mad 923 more likely to advance
3 wbg 326 more likely to advance


and in a similar vein the biggest losers are

1 gam 2897 less likely to advance
2 tl 1737 less likely to advance
3 bds 1674 less likely to advance

with honorary mentions to nrg 62 kt 503 and fnc 426




however i think these stats lose the forest for the trees look at gen and jdg for example they improve from 906 and 853 chance for advancement to 933 and 876 chance respectively their advancement odds dont improve much but their odds of not advancing drop substantially gen is 288 less likely to be knocked out in swiss t1 1735 jdg 1567 the single biggest impact of the draw is not that c9 or mad got a western first opponent its that gen t1 and jdg dodged eastern counterparts and got a far clearer path to 10 kt and blg werent so lucky and got hit with roughly 15 increases in their odds of getting knocked out relatively speaking as soon as it was determined that geng would play gam instead of say wbg we cut down on a whole lot of worlds where geng would go down 01 and worlds where gam would miraculously advance same holds for bds




so where does that leave eu and na frankly pretty much every region except vietnam is left with the same number of expected advancing teams as before just as before the draw we expected around 32 korean teams 3 chinese teams 11 eu teams 7 na teams and virtually 0 vietnamese teams to advance that hasnt noticeably changed with the draw at least up to 110th of an expected advancement to be honest thats kind of the theme with this draw we didnt get anything particularly crazy with matchups and no team comes out ahead or behind by any more than 4 advancement probability in absolute terms

i also really like some of the players like spica and dhokla and for those that dont follow lcs too deeply on twitter the community is really awesome though people are now afraid or too disappointed in the lcs to show their love anymore valid reason the community on twitter shows so much love to the players its really wholesome there often

"hi

this is not a post asking for buffs this is a sequel to the quick thoughts on irelia in the patch 1318 retrospective timestamped here httpsyoutube5scaaogn8nmt1134httpsyoutube5scaaogn8nmt1134 

ampx200b

quick summary 

 phreak talked about how irelia is tied to bork how it would be nice to fix this but its no small change hes 100 right
 ive interviewed a number of masters irelia mains amp otps and put together a consolidated set of suggestions to help with this 
 im only emerald 3 myself so i spent more time just listening and aggregating the thoughts of other experienced high elo players in one place 
 this should also improve sentiment laning against her as an ancillary side effect 

ampx200b

why is bork so strong on her at a systematic level boring stuff here skip this

 her actual ad ratios are quite weak 20 ad ratio on passive 60 ad ratio on q damage 13 ad heal ratio thats basically it not counting w 
 instead her scaling works like this innately she has a lot of attack speed some magic damage on hit and q applies lifesteal  onhit effects
 bork giving her all 3 of those things lifesteal onhit attack speed makes it mandatory and essential to function 
 the hp shred allows her to combat health stackers but is actually fiercely strong into squishy champs as well
 the fact that bork can slow too helps her land her e which is icing on top 
 lesson 1 of irelia is always if you dont buy bork first every single game youre trolling

ampx200b

goals feel free to skip bullets

1 irelias general power is not exclusive to bork

 she can explore other items first without literally trolling she is not a walking bork who dashes around
 currently when bork is strong irelia is strong when bork is weak irelia is weak can cause lots of frustration for both her and opponents
 riot can safely change items however they wish and irelia will not suddenly become op or unplayable and remains stable relative to her light fighter cohorts
 current model of irelias damage and gold scaling is overwhelmingly through onhit items bork and to a lesser extent wits end this is why youll notice she dramatically falls off past the point of obtaining those two items
 people playing against irelia will no longer feel like she is full build at bork and dont have to constantly check her items between 812 minutes out of sheer paranoia she suddenly became thanos

2 top lane is more emphasized as her primary role

 she can play more like a fighter her actual role and less like an assassin long standing meta adaptation 
 this was intended by the original 2018 full rework
 she can of course still kill squishies but this shouldnt be an effortless affair at 1 item were advocating for this being more realistic somewhere in the 2 to 3 item range 
 the irelia fantasy is about kiting enemies through a wave with her very long 200 aa range using q resets on minions and autos on her enemies to dance around shes a blade dancer after all
 assassin irelia game pattern can be something as plain as just q  e1 hide it on minion e2 champion gt q  aa q  aa aa aa aa until dead this executes pretty quickly and resembles an akali allin instead of extended combat like a fighter
 she will have a closer power band to her other horsewomen cohorts who are also light fighter carries
 currently her ability to 1v1 at 3 items on even footing is among the worst of all champions who need to function as duelists and have power budget invested in sidelaning cam fiora riven gwen and yone all considerably outperform her at 3 items on even footing against other top lane champs she will be comparably worse at oneshotting at 1 item however which is more suited to top lane naturally having slightly delayed impact

ampx200b

what shouldnt change free to skip past first bullet

 she doesnt need her overall winrate buffed
 her buttons should still all feel the same her kit is amazing fun and needs no changes
 her w and e should deal the exact same damage q should ideally deal more or less the same minion damage irelia players have all the breakpoints memorized for softening up minions to enable resets this is essential to playing her well and distinguishes the players skill we dont want to force players to relearn the breakpoints from the ground up
 she should not be a universally safe top lane blind pick and should have her fair share of uphill battles like camfiorivengwen has for instance youll notice even a great irelia player and someone who would play her to death back in the day like tf blade has become incredibly stingy with the times he picks her more than ever before irelking predominantly plays her midlane now and has for a while
 teamfighting potency remains the same
 she still remains a fighterdiver and will look to engage on a target and deal as much damage as she can 
 she still fights her way out or dies trying as she does now she does not have much ability to escape  thats intended 

ampx200b

suggestions for accomplishing these goals

1 q does not apply onhits from items

 retains the bonus of 4 stacks magic damage when cast to keep her passive management important
 the damage it deals can now scale more from the ad ratio
 scaling generically off ad lets her consider many different items she can also scale more smoothly and less spikey
 the healing is now less about stacking lifesteal through items and can scale more from the ad ratio
 q can have the hybrid damage profile for fighting tankier targets now more shifted into her passive with a better ratio and less from specific mustbuy items
 hp magic damage is now gone from items and can just be shifted into q we highly recommend having this come online when she is already at 4 stacks to require irelia to land her abilities this is both what makes her fun distinguishes play skill and also help solve the problem of she missed everything and 1 shot me with autos

2 consider reverting the patch 1216 buff to base mr make it 28 instead of 30

 followup option to further disincentivize mid lane if needed 

ampx200b

fun facts more boring stuff feel free to skip 

1 irelia was not intended to be snowball reliant like she is now riots thoughts on this from the designers

2 her kit is very reliable which leads to uninteresting stat checks and makes her more snowball reliant than she should be 2018 rework sought to repair that  
httpsnexusleagueoflegendscomenus201710championroadmapoctober2017httpsnexusleagueoflegendscomenus201710championroadmapoctober2017

3 keep in mind to further deemphasize the snowball reliance they nerfed her early game power considerably in the change from 5 stack to 4 this was a step in the right direction and it definitely helped we just need to continue progressing down that path  read here

closing thoughts

irelias pick rate peaked at 14 near s12s start and now is a notch above 7 which is a notable decrease given her popularity if youre a diehard top lane irelia otp some games you will be zoned off the first 34 waves of minions by darius sett volibear whatever thats fine the 2021 mini rework made this the case and any irelia otp knows how to play this patiently what doesnt feel right is being behind against that bully champ archetype getting your bork around 11 minutes assuming things didnt go to shit and herald might not be up and plates dont fall for another 3 minutes youre at the strongest youll ever be and theres not much opportunity to make it count if the enemy is both favored in the 1v1 and ahead in items meanwhile you need to be mindful of defending lane this wont be the case every game but it can be extremely frustrating to experience sorry but if im zoned off 4 waves by darius where he bases for longsword  cloth armor and im forced to rebound into him irelia deserves a better carrot on the end of the stick than well heres your bork bro make it count or forever be a worse yonecamfioragwenriven insert melee light fighter carry champ here

the changes above with the right tunings would likely solve this problem dedicated irelia players want to play irelia and not be a walking bork this aligns closely with riots preseason goal of removing mythics to emphasize the power and abilities innate to the champions and not be league of items as the meme goes

ampx200b

tldr  if irelia q does not apply onhit from items such as bork 100 bork reliance is gone and future power budget is no longer held hostage the actual specific numerical iteration will take some careful tuning and followup work from a game designer  balancer

"i know that this champion is getting his fair share of hate deserved too but i dont think this change was in the right direction 

i am by no means a ksante onetrick or anything like that but he was in my champion pool before the changes now i dont even wantto play him anymore because it is just not fun almost all the combos were removed you can not q3  flash anymore you cant e  tapw you cant flash  tapw and your q3 expires when you ult the only combo you have now is e  q3  w  r where is the skill expression in that why is riot just killing his entire identity on top of these removes your passive damage in all out is reduced to a flat 35 percent increase which removes a significant amount of damage from his kit understandable so his passive dealt too much true damage in the late game but why are they also removing the damage increase of his w his w is now at a set damage only increased by the bonus ad from all out this w change in particular is resposible for extremely many solo kills not happening because youre not properly able to finish the enemy off i do believe riot needs to revert the w changes cause  if you hit a perfect combo on a 75 health target at level 6 and it does not die it just feels extremely unrewarding all this is not even considering the fact that you have to channel your w for at least 065 seconds which often leads to people flashing away of course the tap w was probably too fast but to wait 065 seconds 05 seconds in all out on a mediocre damage spell which doesnt even have execute damage anymore feels wrong

you also can not heal on anything else but champions anymore the overall healing percentage was lowered aswell in exchange we got 10 more health in the all out form this compensation only leads to more frustration when you ult you lose 85 of your bonus resistances which means you get oneshot lowering the healing makes you even more squishy 10 more health will not help much coupled with his w and passivenerfs you basically dont heal

the atkspeed you get when in allout does not even make any sense because you have 2 aaresets in your kit rendering any excess atkspeed useless lowering the damage when ulting someone through a wall was also reduced should you not be rewarded for ulting someone through a wall yet another skill expression being removed apscaling also doesnt make any sense lol

so what did riotgames achieve with these changes

1 every ksante player hates these changes it removes many skill expressions and very much of the fun factor of ksante
2 ksante is still dashing in 1v5 tanking for an eternity meaning the most toxic part of his kit was not adressed he is still an absolute maniac full tank which dashes into 3 people and knocks them into his team barely losing any hp 
3 kill threat is very low as ksantes damage output was significantly lowered while also reducing his defensive measures omnivamp tapw

ampx200b

how could riot have made better changes

1 nerf passive all out damage maybe let it scale with lvl or just lower the damage increase from 20 per 100 ad amp mr to 15 or 10 per 100 ad amp mr
2 leave core mechanics like q3  flash e  w and the q3 after entering all out in his kit
3 lower overall damage of w maybe take off some percentages while still keeping some sort of damage increase during all out
4 leave his hp during all out at 55 while lowering his omnivamp a little keep in mind he can only heal himself up to 55 that way
5 the lower base health and higher health growth changes were ok aswell as nerfing q in the early levels

what is wrong with letting ksante keep his identity and just lowering his numbers to make him more balanced

anyways i know opinions vary but im still very interested in what other people think

"this might be unpopular but with the swiss stage approaching i find myself wishing there were more teams in it from vietnam hong kong etc what you could consider tier two regions that still perform reasonably well and show interesting gameplay

instead if we think of the swiss stage the heart of the competition before the knockout stage it is dominated by the major regions except for gam

simply put i wish major regions all had 3 seeds each and would only give a 4th seed to the region that won the previous world championship

i understand that the current format strive to guarantee the highest number of quality games however we will still have plenty of them once the knockout stage comes and also i think its really important to give non major regions as much experience as possible to further their development

i think this will be unpopular because wed lose the hype play ins run that bds had and last year a 4th seed won it all but i think giving more exposure and more matches against top regions to minor regions would be beneficial in the long run",Bad Teammates
"ive always been a bit of a tryhard in league because it was the only game i could play on my shitty laptop at the time and i thought thats just how youre supposed to play to a large extent im still that despite being ok with someone playing off meta picks i still kind of just mentally accepted the loss and moved on i never really understood the appeal i guess 

then i built my current pc which can run basically any game i can think of and i got into elden ring a large part of elden ring content online if youre not into pvp and im def not into elden ring pvp lol is challenge runs with weird builds some of my favourite youtubers are lilaggy and bushy if you want an example of what im talking about when i saw their content i really enjoyed it despite me not liking offmeta stuff in league and i think its because elden ring is pve 

imo the biggest problem with playing offmeta in league is that its a team game and theres always someone who wont be ok with you playing suboptimally because they want to win in the more standard way instead of whatever whacky shenanigans your pick gets up to if youre playing something like idk shack support and your adc has never played with a shaco before the lane is gonna be unnecessarily hard right 

this is why i think league needs a good pve mode like odyssey in 2018 its explicitly for fun and maybe you can even grind it for rewards but the important thing is that its playing against an ai so if you decide to go ap graves or something its no big deal 

urf kinda used to be like this before everyone figured out that adcs were the best role even in urf wow shocker adc is op who could have seen this coming but even that was playing against other people i think we can all agree that being the weird off meta pick in urf and being ahead and cheesing everyone is very fun but being the victim of the offmeta pick and being cheesed makes you want to break your monitor

"it seems as though the new meta is aptanks with ad junglers being unusually weak with the exception of graves and briar of note hecarim and belveth are both really weak at the moment

a new meta seems to be forming within some ad junglers where they will do a 3 camp or 4 camp clear into an early base in order to purchase a dorans blade this is in order to be stronger around the 3 minute mark 3 camp version of this may require taking futures market

clearing the jungle across the board seems much slower and junglers seem like theyre being pushed to lower income more supportive role if pros played on this patch i think maokai would be even more prioritized than he is at worlds

"jdg take away playmaking mids from knight ban syndra in orianna matchup  pick adcs that can clutch xayah kaisa be toplevel in macro you have to understand that they lose teamfights only via explosive damageclutch plays they know too much about stable slow and steady teamfighting and draft perfectly around that 

phalanx formation around ruler is nigh impossible to beat in bo5 but smashable in bo3 because they always experiment their vanguardsplaymaker champion drafts against the style of a certain team



blg do not overshove your lanes no hittingskirmishes when your hp is lower than them slow down bin if he isnt winning trades  blg slows down completely beat them by tracking where xun is at all times as they need xun to start deathballs and stress out teams 




lng ban scout azir gala kaisaxayah do jdggeng phalanx formation where you protect adc do not do flippy skirmish around gala early as their draft indexes on rolling from the botlane 



wbg ban weiwei rell light kaisa their botlane cannot win in isolation theshy will always give you gank windows because he will always trade his whole philosophy revolves around me higher hp than you we fight because me better pick hard punish champs with a lot of cc to prevent light and xiaohu from having sparks of genius if not draft to smash botlane 



geng draft to run at them draft a composition where if your team has higher hp pools    gt geng will get rolled as much as peanut cheeses the way geng wins is by damage output that inherently means you need to have worldclass draft creativity and hands ban away sejuani 



t1 ban azir xayah no playmaking  play zeri and phalanx protect make t1 play like shit by ganking fakerzeus via teleport timings these two are the mental weakpoints impossible to beat if you dont have a toplaner as good as zeus as they are the best team in the world when zeus is confident but zeus tilts a lot after lost teamfights toplaner and he tunnels on plates and is thus gankable they cannot teamfight as effectively when zeus is dead 



catch keria when hes trying to initiate a fight the danger in lane is keria not guma their jungler will never overperform against top teams because his jungle pathing is the most studied in the east as he always grinds and exposes his pathing in soloq



kt they like setting vision traps everywhere trap them as they are trying to trap you play 4 group  1 split drafts make sure your toplaner can pass the kiin test 



damwon read and adapt in the middle of the game not before what canyon does tells what lane you should smash weak top and botside stay even they get nervous when they are not ahead if you are jdglngt1geng defts brain gets overloaded with macro decisions and cannot shotcall mid game as it is more important to focus on staying alice as adc make simultaneous cross map actions  multiple things happening on the map via skirmish drafts are one of the easy ways to exploit defts role in the team 



g2 an interesting approach is to win is picking offmeta and smashing lane smashing lane is enough to shake how they draft they will respect eastern draft philosophy too much and try to copy it and forget their own style completely forgetting that they just got hands diffed they didnt press their buttons right and overindex on draft 



mad hylissang does not care about the cost of death he only cares about momentum play defensive and trap him your gold will accrue they are inefficient and cannot play slow cannot play slow  throw everyone else gets jebaited easily in teamfights



bds weak early game laning and macro do not flip when taking objectives either phalanx or just avoid fighting and crossmap they will passively lose out via their inefficient macro suffocate with wallets not objective flips 



nrg if youre a top eastern team you probably will know how to download them and get in their heads best teamfighting team in na but na does not know enough about lol to be a threat they lack info will smash you if you try to statcheck them recklessly tho 



tl good at bo1s because they will always draft more damage than you they dont give a fck about balanced compositions more damage  easier to win fights  easier to capitalize on throws 

but since they draft like this they are useless early game smash lane 



c9 adc centric team will probably have issues against jaxgangplank top players as they will always overindex and their botside is afraid to take risks against eastern teams 

start dragon if you are an eastern team it will always be free 

emenes has weak laning form currently exploit 



gam actually drafts better than 75 of the teams but the macro knowledgegame experience may not be there basically will not be able to play from behind vs top tier teams if they are behind they do not know angles  you win easily

at least with other top champs like kled for example the immunity is conditional and it still requires skill to kill under tower alongside that other champs with immunity to towers in dives have been removed to just be immune to champions champs like pantheon and viego are some examples of this now they only block the damage of champs because their dives were too toxic with it

i can understand making the argument of if you take an extended fight with him in the lane then fine its not a good idea but the dives at level 6 are just so brutal and overbearing with no real counter to it with a good amount of top champs except just refusing to play or going to another lane maybe they could make it so at level 11 it becomes immune to towers or something but having it at level 6 just feels too strong into a decent amount of matchups

edit add this into the fact that he can cast it while suppressed and shit for whatever reason probably because haha old champ but into champs like urgot he can outplay him hit the ult get him under the hp and get the execute and then at last second while getting pulled while suppressed trynd ults and urgot still loses the fight under his own tower ",Bad Teammates

" 1getting flamed in soloq

interviewer 

you have a special playstyle and like to limit test a lot do you ever get flamed or inted by your team in soloq

hylissong

oh yeah it happens a lot you have teammates who go play like 50 games a day then theyre just burned out they feel like i am inting but they dont say it because they are chat restricted right so they bait ping me instead

they dont feel like i am doing anything right and i dont feel like they want to play with me or something so i just roam and make plays happenand it turns into a vicious cycle

this cycle is very exhausting and not productive

 2dealing with toxicity

interviewer

do you ever flame back or how do you deal with this kind of toxicity

hylissong

i usually mute and ignore them sometimes ill add them and ill tell them something and they react the wrong way but thats on me because i didnt choose the right moment especially if they were emotional postgamebut its completely understandable and normal

 3 difference between pro and nonpro schedule

interviewer 

when you became a pro how did your schedule change

hylissong

when i became pro there was a planned schedule on what i should be doing throughout the day when i am playing solo queue when i am having fun when i am going for dinner when i am having gym and when i am having review  all these things planned 

its not spamming games all day long and then you feel like crap going to bed and then the next day is exactly the same

 4benefit of a pro schedule

interviewer

do you see any benefits following the schedule

hylissang

i would say so after one bad thing goes wrong its not like oh my god my mental is very stable strong and im also good mechanically right now i can say thats because of the things i now do before the day starts the more balanced schedule

 5 soloq advice for beginners

interviewer

do you have any advice for people who cant get out of elo hell

hylissong

play champions you personally like  kind of your pocket picks so thats probably it and yeah also try not to dwell on negative thoughts during the game instead be more about having fun and reviewing things if they go south not just ignoring them so just focus on having a good time and not ending the day hating yourself or your teammates

"jdg coming to worlds seems unbeatable 

top 369 might as well call him 789 now with his performance this season he can play carry top he can play a tank for his team he can do anything he plays with kanavi extremely well to do exactly what the team needs from him

jg kanavi  imo the best player in the worldmost impactful right now even more dangerous that hes paired with lpls best middebatable and top if kanavi gets a good start gg

mid knight  probably the weak point of this team not to say he is a bad player in any way he has just shown some inconsistencies especially in global stages still not a player to count out though and is only a weak point due to his exceptional teammates

adc  sup ruler is so fucking good at adc he gives jdg the confidence that allows the team to play at their own pace ahead in the game kanavi 369 will win you the game early game didnt go as planned just wait for ruler to scale theres nobody that can put team fight him

"hello guys i come to propose ideas or changes since i really like champion skarner

regarding skarners new announced abilities i really like the champion and play him a lot  i found the q ability interesting along with the champions kit but adding it to w seems like just a mixture of malphite as if to replace the absence of malphite jg honestly i found w to be more of the same a very ugly recycling it just gives one punch on the ground and you gain malphites passive armor it can change to something more interesting  es ability is new i was excited to test it a combination of it is from his ult ill still miss the scorpions speed but i think e will do the job along with the stun like the old one

 honestly this w needs to be changed in my opinion its just more recycling after 2 years of development i think i could think of something more interesting or more fun for the skill for me its quite discouraging and boring to see this skill dont you think
the idea of w is very basic and dated typical of a character from 2010 they could put something like an improved rug for talya or similar to nautiluss which is a more elaborate version of the same concept and i think thats the problem with skill being an idea without redefining its concept to offer a new experience what can be resolved with a slow effect with quicksand or earthquakes that break the ground being literally slapped to the ground is sad",Champion Design
"as 1320 and now 1321 patches have shown with the changes to morgana zyra and brand riot is trying to broaden the number of champs who are jungle viable even nerfing other parts of their kit slightly after the buffs required for jungle

i think that there is some lowhanging fruit that riot is missing out on and i was wondering what others people had champions who could jungle with minor tweaks feel different to play than current junglers and would be healthy for the game as a whole

chogath all he needs is an increase in his monster cap on his e at rank 1 the 3 max health damage caps at a measly 60 damage  which even slows down his first clear as the level 1 buffs have 23k health without the cap hed do 9 more damage per e  27 more damage per cast while the caps are really designed to prevent champs from taking down objectives too quick while chos ult is great during smite fights the more common tank build is actually really bad at taking down objectives quickly most of his damage comes from ult amp  health on his e

a change on his cap from 6020rank to maybe 10020stack would speed up his first couple clears to be semicompetitive still on the slow side and average at objectives nothing else in his kit would need to change

i think chogath jungle would be healthy for the game since while he has 3 ccs and an execute his lack of gapclosers or any movement keeps him from being too annoying to play against when 23 of his ccs and his execute are closerange and the third is telegraphed unlike if lissandra was made a viable jungler as phreak mentioned

"tldr jungler xp penalties should not reduce the total xp received by the team

ampx200b

junglers receive less xp from lane minions prior to 20 minutes as i understand it this amount is calculated after the xp share is calculated in the current state this means that junglers sharing any lane xp prior to 20 minutes actually reduces the total xp that your team receives

here are a few scenarios where this is problematic

 helping a laner shove out a wave after a successful gank  especially with reduced respawn timers repairing wave state prior to recalling is more important than ever historically laners were usually happy to share this xp with a jungler in exchange for a better wave state and time to recall but if the xp received by the jungler does not make up for the xp lost by sharing the team that won the exchange will suffer 
 helping a losing laner breaking a freeze maybe even defending dives  in situations where a laner is already behind they will often request help from the jungler to mitigate the damage of a losing lane when a team is already at a disadvantage junglers who chose to help a laner actually end up reducing their teams total xp even before considering the opportunity cost of losing camps  objectives elsewhere on the map
 when losing towers  inhibitors  as towers  inhibitors are taken additional siege minions and super minions spawn for the aggressing team this provides the aggressors additional map pressure but also gives the defenders access to more xp as compensation defending junglers may lose the ability to safely access the jungle in these stages of the game and must stay further back on the map with their team without access to camps a jungler is forced to share xp with their team reducing the total xp that their team receives 

as stands right now this mechanic runs counter to the intended behavior of xp sharing  when members of a team are sharing xp the total xp pool is increased in order to compensate for the lower overall xp that each champion receives when one of the champions sharing xp is a jungler nonjunglers are still penalized the same amount for their presence but the jungler only gets to keep a fraction of the xp they took from their teammates if minion xp is going to be used as a lever to balance the jungle role it should be implemented in a way that does not impact the teams overall xp received from minions

ampx200b

now lets put some numbers behind this to understand how much of an impact this really has for context solo xp is granted at a rate of 95 and shared xp is granted at a rate of 116 sourcehttpsleagueoflegendsfandomcomwikiexperience_champion a single wave is 270 xp for a solo laner or 330 xp when shared the examples below are based on shoving a minion wave but the same logic applies to any scenario where the jungler is sharing minion xp

impact at 4 minutes

at 4 minutes into the game the jungler is receiving an xp penalty of 56

solo lane

 if a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave the solo laner will receive 165 xp which is a reduction of 38 due to xp sharing and the jungler would receive 44 of that which is 73 xp
 the team will receive 238 total xp which is 12 less than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all and 28 less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

bot lane

 if a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave each bot laner will receive 110 xp which is a reduction of 33 due to xp sharing and the jungler will receive 44 of that which is 48 xp
 the team will receive 268 total xp which is 19 less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave 

impact at 6 minutes

at 6 minutes into the game the jungler is receiving an xp penalty of 50

solo lane

 if a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave the solo laner will receive 165 xp which is a reduction of 38 due to xp sharing and the jungler would receive 50 of that which is 83 xp
 the team will receive 248 total xp which is 8 less than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all and 25 less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

bot lane

 if a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave each bot laner will receive 110 xp which is a reduction of 33 due to xp sharing and the jungler will receive 50 of that which is 55 xp
 the team will receive 276 total xp which is 17 less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

impact at 10 minutes

at 10 minutes into the game the jungler is receiving an xp penalty of 35

solo lane

 if a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave the solo laner will receive 165 xp which is a reduction of 38 due to xp sharing and the jungler would receive 65 of that which is 107 xp
 the team will receive 273 total xp which is 1 more than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all and 18 less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

bot lane

 if a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave each bot laner will receive 110 xp which is a reduction of 33 due to xp sharing and the jungler will receive 65 of that which is 72 xp
 the team will receive 292 total xp which is 12 less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave 

impact at 14 minutes

at 14 minutes into the game the jungler is receiving an xp penalty of 21

solo lane

 if a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave the solo laner will receive 165 xp which is a reduction of 38 due to xp sharing and the jungler would receive 79 of that which is 131 xp
 the team will receive 296 total xp which is 9 more than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all and 11 less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave

bot lane

 if a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave each bot laner will receive 110 xp which is a reduction of 33 due to xp sharing and the jungler will receive 79 of that which is 87 xp
 the team will receive 307 total xp which is 7 less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave 

ampx200b

how should this be fixed

lost minion xp should be refunded to nonjunglers 

consider the example of a jungler helping to shove a solo lane wave at 4 minutes into the game currently the laner would receive 165 xp and the jungler would receive 73 xp for a total of 238 xp this leaves 32 xp that is completely lost just because the jungler is in the lane give this 32 xp back to the laner so they will now receive 197 xp this is still 28 less xp than the laner would receive if they shoved the wave themselves but now the team as a whole will not be receiving less xp simply due to the jungle being the one who helped shove the wave

the new laner xp can be calculated by subtracting the xp received by the jungler from the total xp received if the jungler were not present for a solo laner that formula would look like this solo_xp  shared_xp  jungle_xp_multiplier

270  165  44  197

ampx200b

in the current state how can i mitigate the impact of jungle xp penalties on my team

 junglers should avoid sharing xp with solo laners prior to 10 minutes not only does the laner receive less xp when the jungler is there but the xp that the jungler receive does not even make up for it until 10 minutes into the game
 junglers should avoid sharing xp with two or more laners for most of the game the total penalty to the team for a jungler sharing xp with bot lane at 10 minutes is the same as the penalty for sharing xp with a solo lane at 4 minutes this penalty steadily decreases throughout the game but does not go away until the jungle xp penalty expires at 20 minutes  keep those ganks short and sweet
 when possible supports and other nonjunglers should help fix waves instead of junglers especially early on in the game

" i am talking now as a talon main and i have been starving to make talon a popular pick but it seems like no one cares about that champ we thought maybe he would be in that boy band because he really really fits imagine him using a guitar or drums or maybe singing idk i know alot of people will make fun but i am so sick and tired of talon being unpopular and old

i am just saying that talon have no legendary skin and he is 12 years old kayn got 2 

talon has the same design since 2011 and only 16 voice lines not counting his grunts and they are super generic and old and jhin has like 241 just searched that

talon made it today to 536 days with no skin we as talon mains hoped that he will be in the boy band becuase he fits more than ksante and sett and it would have made him popular it really would have helped his pick rate

what about we forget about the boy band yonesettezreal already got a skin this year not counting other champs like leona that got like 4 skins in 1 year last year but sure  i am fine with 1 skin a year not 1 skin every 536 days 

i am super frustrated that no one cares no one replys by a confirmation that talon is atleast in mind no we are just being ignored and dunked but anyways

talons animation and god they are awful they are sooo bad look at his base skin like damn his autos are soo bad and his crits  his cape just doing the few few animation every time he moves is soo bad and his w looks like dull blades

like bro talon has the potential to be popular and good but no one is giving him a chance he is the face of the assassins bro

three western and three eastern teams at 22 if any western teams draw each other about 60 one is guaranteed top 8 in the other case east vs west east vs west and east vs west some of the best western teams at the tournament get three opportunities to
beat some of the weaker eastern teams at the tournament well be pessimistic and say each western team only has  around a 15 chance of winning their bo3 at 22 against the eastern team thats still  40 10853 for any western team to win their matchup

so yeah in pretty much the worst case unless gam goes 22 or better theres still a 75 10406 chance of a western team making it into top 8",Bad Teammates

"so i played vayne vs sett and got stomped cause that guy started tower diving me at lvl 3 and just didnt stop anymore   
what i wonder though how can someone farm constantly push your lane and still have my wave push into his side i had like 50 farm at the end of the game the dude was about 3 elos above me i only last hitted if anything and somehow my lane still always built up a big wave and pushed into his  


the only thing that happened once was that my jungle killed all minions so a big wave of sett under my tower   


i know the pizzaslides thing with how many minions i need moreless than my enemy to freeze and stuff i just dont know how i dont farm and my wave still pushes into his it was the most frustrating game ever  


help would be greatly appreciated",Game Balance
"im just throwing this post out to the wind and hoping for the best

besides the toxicity one thing i tend to see people say regarding why they dont play league is that matches are too long and with the upcoming preseason changes im worried the average match length will get even longer

let me get this out of the way yes wild rift exists and it has 1520 minute matches but its a mobile game and people might not like playing games on their phones or they simply dont have a powerful enough one to run the game plus wr doesnt have every champ and skin that pc does

so as a very casual player of pvp games all i want is a permanent nongimmicky so not like urf mode like dota 2s turbo mode tfts hyper roll or valorants swift play just the base game mode but much faster with this existing people who want the regular mode to be longer and slower could get what they want right

edit also quick play is gonna replace blind pick but its more about getting into games faster rather than the matches themselves being faster",Bad Teammates

"i can understand being unkillable by champions thats fine but i dont see why he gets to be immune to towers for 5 seconds on demand at level 6 this makes the situation of you take 1 negative trade against him in lane now he perma sustains up with his q and then just afk walks at you under tower and you die no skill no skillshots no spacing just walks at you

at least with other top champs like kled for example the immunity is conditional and it still requires skill to kill under tower alongside that other champs with immunity to towers in dives have been removed to just be immune to champions champs like pantheon and viego are some examples of this now they only block the damage of champs because their dives were too toxic with it

i can understand making the argument of if you take an extended fight with him in the lane then fine its not a good idea but the dives at level 6 are just so brutal and overbearing with no real counter to it with a good amount of top champs except just refusing to play or going to another lane maybe they could make it so at level 11 it becomes immune to towers or something but having it at level 6 just feels too strong into a decent amount of matchups

edit add this into the fact that he can cast it while suppressed and shit for whatever reason probably because haha old champ but into champs like urgot he can outplay him hit the ult get him under the hp and get the execute and then at last second while getting pulled while suppressed trynd ults and urgot still loses the fight under his own tower ",Bad Teammates

"while i generally like new worlds format and enjoy it it is embarrassing how awkwardly long we have to wait for the tournament this year especially for regions like lpl

tomorrow they will finally play at worlds stage and it takes them  80 days from qualification and 73 days from finals more than the split was itself we basically could have one more a complete lpl split in this window cant imagine how it feels for players to have such intense spring split msi and summer playing 23 times per week with almost no pauses to then chill for basically 3 month to play at worlds all momentum is lost and not to mention that worlds is on patch 1319  6 patches  ahead of their last competitive experience together

its 2019 there are 3 competitive regions on the world stage wild cards and na the community is split on who to call the favorites g2 won msi fnatic had two 5 game series against them invictus gaming are the reigning champions fpx beat them to win lpl t1 looks scary when they won lck while the raw potential of dwg and griffin makes them a contender

nobody shouldve had any doubts who would win after the worlds song was realeased however fly fly phoenix fly fpx  funplus phoenix  was revealed as the champions by riot before the tournament even began its time for a new empire china were to become the new overlords as demanded by sun emperor tencent

why does it matter riot released the worlds song gods some of you will say well actually that would just mean team whales vs t1 in the finals so artemis can face off against zeus duh and it would be an obvious conclusion but team whales are out its not happening

we were given the key by the casters over and over again to decypher the message they keep talking about adams champion pool especially his garen olaf darius and sett gods

but there is more while the song is called gods there is a line that reveals the whole truth once you play god once play god they gonna crumble one by one the s is missing garen olaf darius and sett have a 100 win rate currently when played by adam sett however will turn out to be a false prophet that adam has to forsake to bring victory to his team

"there is a tension between using a global ban outside of your role and using a local ban specific to your role for instance if youre a toplaner and you ban a strong jungler or youre a support who bans a strong midlaner so how about if each team could ban one champ from each of the three center roles without doubling bans to 2 per player too many imo

in s1 each team had 2 bans followed by 3 bans shared by the whole team the current sweet spot of 1 ban per player is quite nice this proposal would take the 3 shared bans and add them to the current 1 ban per player as an alternative to the status quo or to doubling the amount of bans to 2 per player which imo would be too many

however these 3 shared bans would be split among 3 roles one player is given dictatorship of the 3 shared bans however they can only select a ban that is suggested by the other 4 players

when a player is in the ban phase they select several champions to add to a temporary banlist the ux would resemble the current suggest ban except also show a history of champions hovered over during the ban phase banlists can also be saved and imported like runepages so you wont have to search champions every time the one they are currently hovering over is highlighted and perhaps a slightly larger icon that is still smaller than preselect icon

after a short delay simultaneously your personal ban is locked in for your team and then suggested ban list is finalised the dictator is then given 10 seconds to choose from the aggregated ban list each players banlist is at most 3 champions long so the dictator has up to 12 champions to choose from if any champion has 2 suggestions without being preselected they are automatically banned without the dictator choosing if 2 champions are tied for the role ban then the dictator chooses between them

why not top and support personally i feel like the flavour of toplane is one of uncomfortable matchups and being an island that needs help but cannot receive enough jungler attention or conversely is an island where you stomp the opponent but the enemy jungler cannot afford more assistance without worrying about a global ban eg jungler midlane assassin youll always have a toplane ban for yourself two toplane bans would harm the lane vibe too much similar story with botlane since it now receives up to 3 bans 2 personal bans  1 adc roleban

so psg will remain the eliminated team with the fewest loss and only the 2 teams going undefeated through the swiss could hope matching this score you cant be out of swiss with less than 4 loss

ive seen another post saying the play in finals should have been a double elimination too and tbh even being rooting for bds i found hard for psg to be out of a single bo5 when both qualifiying teams had another chance and went through the looser bracket
