new,"Broke League by trying to switch to windowed mode, help!","Hi, I recently got into League of Legends, and while the game is great, i really like being able to exit full screen without leaving the game, so while using practice tool, in the settings, I switched to borderless (did nothing), and then windowed, which crashed my game.  
I got booted me back to the client locked into the screen with ""reconnect"" being the only option other than social, profile, and settings, and unfortunately you can't change the game settings for the screen mode, unless you're in game. After trying to reconnect, i'd get black/ white window, which would bug out, and have to be force closed after not responding.   
So I downloaded Hextech Repair Tool, reinstalled the game and now i'm completely unable to even open the game window, only client.  
Has this happened to anyone? I'm on windows.

new,Prayers for T1,"For T1

Hi everyone,

I don't normally make these posts, but just wanted to share how I feel about the upcoming Worlds 2023 as a long time T1 fan.

I've watched T1 play since their 2013 debut, and have cheered the team on ever since. I've been heavily invested in the ups and downs of the team, and for the past 2 years it's been rough. 

The current T1 roster for some reason makes me so emotionally invested... Despite their potential, they've fell short from earning any international titles.

That being said, watching the individual videos of T1 players expectations and thoughts on the upcoming championship truly makes me sad... it really does feel like regardless of the outcome, we will see a change to this roster.

All in all, I truly wish the best for this team and I will send them my energy for every game of this tournament. I know they can be the protagonist for this tournament and truly represent what Deft has sad about unbreakable will.

new,My experience as a lee sin one trick in aram.,"Ah, another day dawns, and what better way to spend it than indulging in my ARAM addiction, featuring my beloved Lee Sin.

I graciously rise from my 29-ARAM-marathon-induced slumber at the highly productive hour of 2 am. With immense enthusiasm, I shout to the heavens, ""ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TRIUMPH IN THE PRESTIGIOUS ARAM MODE OF LEAGUE OF LEGENDS!""

As I click the ""League of Legends"" icon, I'm greeted by an enigmatic app called ""Riot Client"" – it dares to demand my ""username"" and ""password."" Curiosity piqued, I decide to create a fresh account of the day. Behold, ""LeEsinsblind"" is born, and it tells me I've successfully signed up in OCE, a realm I have absolutely no clue about! Riot Games, the masterminds behind League of Legends, must've recognized my true potential and granted me this unheard-of rank!

I dive into a brisk warm-up ARAM, and what do you know, Lee Sin graces me with his presence. To clarify for the less enlightened among you, Lee Sin is a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-everything champion. His hidden passive? Rendering me blind as a bat, and not due to any moonshine incident, mind you.

His Q ability is an auto-targeted missile that homes in on the nearest ADC, whether in this game or the next, revealing their location and providing me with vital information like their credit score and their mother's relationship status. If I'm not satisfied with their financial health, a quick Q-press sends them packing, wiping their League account and transferring their gold to my offshore bank account.

My W ability involves dashing to an ""Ally"" and shielding them, but let's be real; shields are overrated when you've already started the game with four Death Dances and can heal from true damage. No big deal.

My E, well, it marks the area around Lee Sin, essentially functioning as an AoE nuke. Unfortunately, it only obliterates nearby champions and provides a meager 300 in-game currency. Such a pittance, I know.

And now, Lee Sin's pièce de résistance, his ultimate, R. Trying to explain it to mere mortals is a task reserved for the elite minds of at least Bronze 4. I'll demonstrate its incredible power in due course.

As the game begins, the enemy team quakes in terror at the mere sight of me, Lee Sin, who shows no mercy. I order them to line up in front of their nexus, as their towers and inhibitors have wisely sworn allegiance to my cause. Their feeble cries fall on deaf ears as I meticulously pass judgment with my Q, one by one.

But this becomes tiresome; I'm already drained from the monumental effort of queuing up. So, I hit that E button, instantly obliterating all players and granting me a handsome stack of gold to purchase my one and only necessary item: Duskblade of Draktharr. I even Venmo some random Ornn player to upgrade it to Draktharr's Shadowcarver because, let's face it, I'm too busy being awesome.

The enemy team attempts to surrender, realizing their futility against my unparalleled might, but I, the benevolent Lee Sin, reject their pleas as I eagerly await the airdrop of my new item.

At last, I decide it's time to claim my rightful victory. I casually stroll up to the enemy Rammus, who's rocking a cool 971 armor, and press my ultimate at him. Together, we watch in awe as he rockets towards his own nexus, shattering their base, and presumably, his monitor along with it.

The victory screen warmly welcomes me, and with the profound humility only Lee Sin can muster, I queue up for another exhilarating All Random All Mid. Because really, why waste time on anything else?",ereface,1697669224.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b3po5/my_experience_as_a_lee_sin_one_trick_in_aram/

Exhibit C, Jg or mid soaking exp passively.

new,Why not embrace bot lane APCs?,"I frequently see people sad about certain mages being pushed out of mid lane because of how the game of League has evolved. Makes me wonder why we don’t see more bot lane APCs? I think, at this point, Seraphine and Swain prove that it’s perfectly fine to do. You don’t really need an ADC for objectives anymore since everyone deals so much damage and every role has champions with good single target or attack speed scaling. Why not take more mages into the bot lane role? Mages usually scale pretty nicely so why not put them in a place where they have a babysitter that can help them scale and a (usually) squishy and immobile ADC to play around.

A little background on my situation: I’m a multi-account master tier ADC main looking to give something back to the community that I grew up with through solo queue coaching. I’ve tutored both in college and high school, but outside of that I have no coaching experience in league or anywhere else. I sometimes review vods of my friends/mutuals to help others improve, and overall I have a very strong sense of macro knowledge in my particular role. I found that there are very few ADC educational content creators, coaches and resources compared to other roles so I figure the market is open to ADC coaches at the moment.

I am looking at the first page of google for coaching services and applying to each one I am qualified for. However, I am a bit stuck on what exactly I should be doing to get prepared. So far I’ve:
-Watched countless Challenger ADC Coaching videos on YT
-Began setting up a Coachify profile

My question is, what are the best coaching services right now I should look to be a part of to start as and grow myself as a coach? Or is building my own service a better option despite a lack of experience? What should I be doing to prepare for my first few sessions?

new,League needs a good PvE mode,"I've always been a bit of a tryhard in league because it was the only game I could play on my shitty laptop at the time and I thought that's just how you're supposed to play. To a large extent I'm still that despite being ok with someone playing off meta picks I still kind of just mentally accepted the loss and moved on. I never really understood the appeal I guess. 

Then I built my current pc which can run basically any game I can think of and I got into elden ring. A large part of elden ring content online (if you're not into PvP and I'm def not into elden ring PvP lol) is challenge runs with weird builds. Some of my favourite YouTubers are LilAggy and Bushy if you want an example of what I'm talking about. When I saw their content I really enjoyed it despite me not liking offmeta stuff in league and I think it's because elden ring is PvE. 

Imo the biggest problem with playing offmeta in league is that it's a team game and there's always someone who won't be ok with you playing suboptimally because they want to win in the more standard way instead of whatever whacky shenanigans your pick gets up to. If you're playing something like idk shack support and your adc has never played with a shaco before the lane is gonna be unnecessarily hard right? 

This is why I think League needs a good PvE mode like Odyssey in 2018. It's explicitly for fun and maybe you can even grind it for rewards but the important thing is that it's playing against an AI so if you decide to go ap graves or something it's no big deal. 

Urf kinda used to be like this before everyone figured out that ADCs were the best role even in urf (wow shocker adc is op who could have seen this coming) but even that was playing against other people. I think we can all agree that being the weird off meta pick in urf and being ahead and cheesing everyone is very fun but being the victim of the offmeta pick and being cheesed makes you want to break your monitor.

new,How do you beat JDG,"JDG coming to worlds seems unbeatable 

Top: 369- might as well call him 789 now with his performance this season. He can play carry top, he can play a tank for his team, he can do anything. He plays with Kanavi extremely well to do exactly what the team needs from him.

Jg: kanavi - imo the best player in the world(most impactful) right now. Even more dangerous that he’s paired with LPL’s best mid(debatable) and top. If Kanavi gets a good start, gg.

Mid: Knight - probably the ‘weak point’ of this team. Not to say he is a bad player in any way, he has just shown some inconsistencies especially in global stages. Still not a player to count out though, and is only a weak point due to his exceptional teammates.

ADC + Sup: Ruler is so fucking good at adc. He gives JDG the confidence that allows the team to play at their own pace. Ahead in the game? Kanavi 369 will win you the game. Early game didn’t go as planned? Just wait for Ruler to scale, there’s nobody that can put team fight him. 
Ruler + missing is also very formidable in lane this season- honestly 0 downsides for these two.

So a few weeks ago there was some complaints that Bel'Veth had INSANE soloq banrate due to how broken she (it?) was, and Riot's response was that they wanted to see her at worlds. After worlds patch she was insta nerfed. Ive checked the stats, and turns out she was only pick/ban once: at worlds qualifier GG vs BDS by GG River at game 2, which he lost, so 100% lose rate. No team so far has bothered to look at her, why? Do the weaker teams simply fail to see her potential, and she will start being picked at the main event now by the stronger teams? Does she simply not fit into the meta?",gojiragu,1697660164.0,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b07u7/belveth_hasnt_been_picked_or_banned_once_in/

new,Singed Rework Concept," Goals of this concept:

1. Highlight his Identity of a twisted doctor with tons of body-horror
2. Keep Q and E, change the rest
3. make him use his shield properly

&amp;#x200B;

**Passive**  
**Careful Observation**

**INNATE:** Singed's basic attacks are empowered to deal 5-81 (Level 1-18) (+ 30% AP) bonus magic damage and causes him to enter Observation against the target for 5 seconds.

This effect cannot occur on the same target once every 30 / 25 / 20 (Levels 1/7/13) seconds (affected by ability haste).

**OBSERVATION:** Singed raises his shield in the target enemy's direction, gaining 10-40% (Level 1-18) (+ 1% per 300 bonus Health) (+ 1% per 100 bonus armor) (+ 1% per 100 bonus magic resistance) damage reduction in that direction.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q**  
**Poison Trail**

Static Cooldown: 1 | Cost: 10 Mana per Second

**PASSIVE:** While Poison Trail is toggled off, Singed gains 2 / 3.5 / 5 / 6.5 / 8% bonus armor and magic resistance and 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15 bonus health regeneration.

**TOGGLE:** Singed gains 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 12% bonus movement speed and continually creates a toxic cloud in his wake that lingers for 3.25 seconds. The cloud inflicts Poison to enemies within, and resets the duration every 0.5 seconds while they remain.

**POISON:** The target takes 4 / 7 / 10 / 13 / 16 (+ 10% AP) magic damage every 0.25 seconds, slows them by 20% and grounds them over 2 seconds. Subsequent inflictions refresh the duration.

&amp;#x200B;

**W**  
**Injection from Afar**

Static Cooldown: 2 | Cost: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 Mana

**ACTIVE:** Singed shoots a syringe in the target direction which stops at the first enemy hit, dealing 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100 (+ 45% AP) magic damage and stunning them for 1 second.

Singed gains a Charge of Injection from Afar every 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 seconds, up to a maximum of 2 Charges.

&amp;#x200B;

**E**  
**Fling**

Cooldown: 10 / 9.5 / 9 / 8.5 / 8 | Cost: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Mana

**ACTIVE:** Singed flings the target enemy 550 units over himself, dealing 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 (+ 60% AP) (+ 7 / 7.5 / 8 / 8.5 / 9% of the target's maximum Health) magic damage, capped against minions and monsters.

After the cast time, he enters Observation against the flung target for 5 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

**R**  
**The Host**

Cooldown: 160 / 140 / 120 | Cost: 100 Mana

**PASSIVE:** Enemy champions damaged by Singed are marked for 4 seconds.

**ACTIVE:** Singed pulls all marked targets in the center relative to their position and merges them into one unit called Experiment for 4 seconds.

The Experiment has 345 movement speed and it's health consists of 100% of all merged target's current health. The Experiment is disarmed and grounded. All merged champions can cast abilities and put in the location where the unit should go, although the Experiment will go to the (hierarchically) first location.

Singed and his allies can damage the Experiment, where 40 / 50 / 60% of all post-mitigation damage dealt to this unit will also be dealt to all merged enemies at the end of the duration. If the Experiment dies, all merged champions also die.",SpringBossLP,1697659706.0,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b01eq/singed_rework_concept/

new,Nofe’s Worlds 2023 Swiss Stage Meta Predictions,"Just something to read before Worlds 2023 swiss stage starts. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fen_ihkqdPA) 

Nofe was a former league coach, and is currently an LCK caster. This is a quick review of the 2023 Worlds Play-ins meta, alongside a prediction of how the meta will shift during the Swiss stage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Translation**

As always, I’m going to focus on drafts and meta instead of hyperfocusing on individual teams. So my goal is to guess the swiss stage meta by taking a look at what worked well in playins.  

If you look at how metas shifted during various stages of previous Worlds, there is a very obvious trend.  Obviously, play-in teams have a much lower level of play - and this is reflected in their drafts. These teams tend to draft with a focus on teamfights. In the later stages of the tournament, the stronger teams are much more lane focused. And this isn’t just a matter of preference. In the play-in stage, teamfight–focused comps tend to have a much higher winrate.  

This pattern held in this years playins. Despite all the speculation about how the Worlds patch would play out, the play-in stage meta was all about teamfighting. That being said, the meta will probably change drastically once the swiss stage begins. Just like how previous metas shifted drastically during the group stage. The best Asian teams are very good at snowballing off of lane advantages, which is the reason why lower tier teams have such a hard time pulling off upsets. Anyways, the swiss stage meta will probably be completely different from the playin stage meta, and my predictions are attempting to account for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TOP** 

 Keeping that in mind, let’s take a look at which champions had priority during playins. Starting with top. There were 2 picks that stood out – K'sante and Renekton. Renekton’s MR nerfs compounded with the statikk shiv nerfs made it look like split pushers like GP, Gnar and Gwen would dominate the meta, but these champions didn’t manage to make it onto the stage. Defying expectations, K’sante and Renekton held strong. When teams were forced to blind pick top, most teams chose to pick Renekton. These teamfight powerhouses were popular, especially among weaker teams. Interestingly, K’sante fared very well in the head to head against Renekton. Renekton’s greatest strengths are his lane priority into his strong Herald fights, but K’sante neutralized these advantages very well. Rumble and Kennen were also strong picks into Renekton, especially when paired with Jayce Mid. I believe this AP top / Jayce mid pattern will carry on into the Swiss stage. If you look at the results, K’sante did much better than Renekton. Renekton was much weaker than previous patches, especially against AP tops. Oh, and Adam’s GODS were definitely interesting to watch. I’m not sure how well these picks will work out in the swiss stage against the strong asian top laners. They all play mean Gnars, and there’s also a slight chance that some Asian tops will counter with Fiora, reminiscent of former Worlds. Since this is a meta where junglers actually go top, it will be interesting to see how the Asian teams interpret GODS. 

So, what do I expect to see during the swiss stage? To begin with, I predict a lot of Kennens and Gnars. And maybe Gangplank depending on the player. I don’t want to get too deep into this, since it’ll take a long time to explain, but the top pool depends on the mid pool. With the popularity of Syndra and Orianna, ‘standing mages’ that have a hard time side laning, top lane champions with strong side laning abilites will naturally become much better. Champions like Jax. These champions and their lane counters will become much more prominent in the Swiss stage.

&amp;#x200B;

**JG** 

 Moving on to Jungle. If you look at solo queue statistics, Lee Sin, Nidalee and Jarvan look very powerful. But so far, this trend didn’t make it’s way into pro play. Maokai dominated. Of course, there’s a chance that this is due to the fact that playin teams prefer teamfighting champs. Taliyah was also a high priority pick. I thought about the JG picks for a very long time, and I’ve arrived at a conclusion. Which jungles will be meta? I’m sorry to say this, but I expect Maokai and Sejuani to be the most contested jungles. Syndra, Orianna, and Azir are going to me the mid meta champs - no question about that. These champions need a strong dependable frontline. Will top play this role? No. Jax and Gnar are going to be splitpushing. Which leads to the natural conclusion – we’re going to see tank jungles like Sejuani and Maokai. I expect lots of Maokai, Sejuani, Jarvan, and Vi. Maybe Nocturne to aid the splitpushing top, or even some Viegos. In other words, the champs we’ve seen all summer, with the addition of Jarvan. With Lee Sin, I’m not sure. Despite currently performing well in solo queue and scrims, Lee generally tends to do poorly on stage. Some LCK teams like T1 and DK who love snowballing might take the risk, and LPL teams like BLG might try as well. Lee Sin works well with Sylas Galio and Lissandra, which are all champions that Yagao excels at. 

 Oh, and slightly unrelated, but there has to be an LCK or LPL team that plays Taliyah all the time in scrims. The playin teams drafted heavily around Taliyah, especially BDS. Teams seem to place rate Taliyah very highly, which personally didn’t make much sense looking in from the outside. Taliyah does have swap value though, so some LCK and LPL teams might bust her out on stage.  

&amp;#x200B;

**MID** 

 Next, on to mid. Despite all of the nerfs, Azir is still a strong meta pick. With a strong skill set, good late game value and playmaking ability, Azir simply refuses to leave the pro meta. The skill set is one that pro players refuse to give up. Azir is just too good at parrying kill threats from champs like Rakan and Jarvan. And Azir’s late game value is strong too, melting tanks and poking. The champion is too perfect. Yone and Akali match well into Azir though, so expect to see a few of those. The Asian mids are all great at Yone and Akali. Their mere existence prevents blind pick Azir, which I expect to limit Azir’s impact on the meta post swiss stage.  

 This patch, Orianna and Syndra are insane. If you look at the data, both champs have high presence, and Syndra’s win rate is off the charts. Since stronger teams tend to put higher priority on laning, these champions will become even more important as time progresses. Expect to see more of these two, not less. I expect that all of you know about Showmaker’s Syndra, or Faker’s infamous Orianna shockwave. No matter who you look at, be it Bdd, Knight, Yagao, etc., all of the Korean/Chinese mid laners are extremely proficient at playing Orianna and Syndra. Not a single player is bad on these champs – maybe Xiaohu? But even Xiaohu was once famous for his mid mages. There are no weak players. Neeko is also a strong playmaking pick alongside ADCs like Kaisa, and I expect to see some Neekos, but her laning is not quite as strong as it once was. It really depends on the team and the players. Sylas/Akali/Yone will be utilized by teams focused on midgame, especially teams that prefer strong mid carries like Gen G and DK. There is a good chance that we see these champs. Sylas may have a hard time laning against AP mid mages, but he does have an advantage against team comps with powerful ults. Maokai, Sejuani, Gnar and GP all have strong ults, furthering the case for Sylas. Last but not least, Leblanc could see some minor play paired with Lee Sin. All in all, the mid meta is interesting because there are so many champions that could see fringe play. Even Galio and Lissandra could see some play. Tristana and Annie are not as strong anymore, I would prefer Jayce over Tristana.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bot** 

When you build a team comp, the choice of ADC is the most important thing to consider. The entire team composition is warped around the choice of ADC. In that sense, there are 2 champions that have very distinct flavors – Xayah and Kaisa. If your team has Xayah, the goal is to make the other team come into you. You want 2 things - a sturdy front line and long range. Xayah comps go hand in hand with mid mages and with long range mids. Azir, Jayce, Tristana. Force the enemy to engage, and let Xayah clean up. 

Kaisa is the polar opposite of Xayah. The entire teamfight revolves around how well you can focus fire a single priority target when Kaisa ults in. Kaisa loves champions like Yone, Ahri, and Neeko. Not that Kaisa can’t be used with, say Orianna, but if you want to make the most use out of Kaisa’s DPS, you need to draft a dive comp. 

 Ezreal, Aphelios and Zeri made their mark during playins. Looking at solo queue data, the best ADCs were champs like Ezreal, Ashe, Kalista and Jhin. All supportive ADCs, without a single hypercarry. The ADC carry meta was nonexistant. But in play-ins, the meta did a 180 and shifted towards hypercarry ADCs. But it’s impossible to tell how the meta will shift during the swiss stage. LCK and LPL teams can take a bot lane advantage and snowball the entire game off of that, so we could see a lot of Ezreal Karma, Kalista + @, Caitlyn + @, etc. If teams can manage to annihilate Kaisas and Xayahs during the laning phase, the ADC tier list can change drastically. So it’s really hard to predict what will be strong until we actualy see what happens on stage. And since ADCs are the backbone of team comps, drafts will be completely different depending on what ends up on top. 

 If it turns out that supportive ADCs like Ashe and Jhin are dominant, then teams will start playing around mid game comps. In this case, they’re going to have to find late game value somewhere else – which will probably result in a surge in popularity of powerful splitpushing top laners. So the Top meta depends on the ADC tier list. It’ll be fun to see what ends up on top. No one knows what’s going to be good. But if there’s one thing I’m certain of, it’s that utility supports are really *really* weak compared to previous seasons. So we’ll be seeing lots Nautilus, Rakan and Rell. This points towards Kalista being strong and Ezreal/Caitlyn being weak, but it’s hard to tell. Sivir isn’t bad, and teams with skilled support players might play Senna, since Senna funnels gold into supports. But I think that Kalista will be the staple meta ADC. If initiation supports are meta, then Kalista will be used to both compliment them and to have a strong laning phase. Kalista is good at transfering bot lane dominace into the upper half of the map. And she pairs off with mid mages very well. And people have this perception that Kalista is complete crap late game, but she’s stronger than you’d think, even though she doesn't compare to actual hypercarry ADCs. 

I could be totally wrong, and the meta could shift to something I couldn’t have dreamed of in a million years. Just take this as my personal take. The meta will change from swiss to knock out to Finals, so it’s really impossible to tell at this point. To summarize my personal opinion,  

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary** 

Predictions before play-ins: Supportive ADC’s like Ashe and Jhin will be meta, Top &amp; JG will play carry picks, mid mages will be strong. 

&amp;#x200B;

The playin meta: ADC hypercarry meta, and junglers mostly played tanks. Mid mages were strong.  

&amp;#x200B;

Swiss stage predictions: We will have a Top &amp; Jungle Carry meta, with a few ADC hypercarry comps sprinkled in depending on the team. Teams will try to snowball through bot and roll the snowball up to top. And in the process, the high priority champions will be strong side laners like Gnar, Gwen, Jax and bot snowball champs like Kalista. Some ADCs might play hypercarry ADCs like Xayah and Kaisa. Azir, Syndra, and Orianna will be strong picks in the midlane.

Hi! I'm Yoon. Just wanted to post a quick(or maybe not so quick?) meta prediction before the swiss stage starts. Nofe usually has the best draft analysis among various public League analysts, so I wanted to share his take on the meta. With Swiss stage starting in a few hours, I thought it would be a good time to get this translated.",yoonitrop12,1697657019.0,40,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17ayzta/nofes_worlds_2023_swiss_stage_meta_predictions/
new,Why the Swiss Format is the West's true hope this Worlds! I ran the numbers.,"I've never seen the Swiss format before, so I decided to create a Python script to simulate it. I ran this simulation millions of times, collecting data for analysis. What I've found is quite interesting.

A common narrative I’m hearing about Swiss from people who’ve seen it in other esports is that “if there’s an upset things will get weird.”  

While it’s true, it’s also missing something big: **The Swiss stage does not need upsets to get weird.**

To prove this point I want to rank the teams, and to remove my own bias we can use the outright betting odds from multiple sites and take the averages. This is what it looks like.



| Rank | Region | Team | Outright Win Odds |
|------|--------|------|--------------|
| 1    | LPL    | JDG  | 1.445        |
| 2    | LCK    | Gen.G | 4.389        |
| 3    | LPL    | LNG  | 5.515        |
| 4    | LCK    | T1   | 7.53         |
| 5    | LPL    | WBG  | 9.083        |
| 6    | LPL    | BLG  | 9.333        |
| 7    | LCK    | KT   | 12.41        |
| 8    | LCK    | DK   | 14.5         |
| 9    | LEC    | G2   | 40.553       |
| 10   | LEC    | FNC  | 78.333       |
| 11   | LEC    | MAD  | 88.667       |
| 12   | LCS    | C9   | 98.333       |
| 13   | LCS    | NRG  | 177.777      |
| 14   | LCS    | TL   | 252.777      |
| 15   | LEC    | BDS  | 275          |
| 16   | VCS    | GAM  | 444.444      |

Thankfully region distribution works out neatly, the top 8 teams are from the LCK and LPL, and there’s a bit of a gulf between DK (rank 8) and G2 (rank 9).

Let’s define an upset as any rank 9-16 team beating a rank 1 to 8 team, which is the same as saying an upset is an LEC/LCS/VCS team beating a LCK/LPL team.

I ran the simulation while setting the chance of upsets to 0%, and gave regions win rates. Here’s a chart of it.

| Region 1 | Region 2 | Region 1 WR(%) |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| LCK      | LCK      | 50%             |
| LCK      | LPL      | 50%             |
| LCK      | LCS      | 100%            |
| LCK      | LEC      | 100%            |
| LCK      | VCS      | 100%            |
| LPL      | LPL      | 50%             |
| LPL      | LCS      | 100%            |
| LPL      | LEC      | 100%            |
| LPL      | VCS      | 100%            |
| LCS      | LCS      | 50%             |
| LCS      | LEC      | 50%             |
| LCS      | VCS      | 50%             |
| LEC      | LEC      | 50%             |
| LEC      | VCS      | 50%             |
| VCS      | VCS      | 50%             |
| VCS      | PI       | 50%             |


To summarise the chart, if a 1 to 8th ranked team is playing a 9 to 16th ranked team, they have a 100% win rate, every other matchup is a 50% win rate. 

Now this is where things get juicy.

I ran the simulation 100k times and these are the results.

**Without ever beating an LCK or LPL team, 1 or more LEC/LCS/VCS teams advance in 62% of simulations.**

The real clever ones reading this probably have also realised that for this to be true, LPL/LCK teams will be going home without ever losing to anyone but LPL/LCK teams.

Pretty cool for the west right? Bare in mind these stats above are an absolute minimum as clearly the Western teams will have a better win rate against LPL/LCK teams than 0%... surely.

If we compare Swiss with the old Groups format using the same seeding pools, you’ll see how much better this format is for us. 

With the old format, using the same win-rate method as above, not a single LEC/LCS/VCS team will ever advance to quarters. This is because each group will have an LCK team and an LPL team and they will get 4 wins plus, meanwhile this means the other 2 teams lose 4 each at a minimum.

Due to the increased randomness of Swiss over the old Groups stage, and to the detriment of getting the true best 8 teams into the finals, the west is definitely happy here. Should we feel bad that it’s very likely an LCK / LPL team will drop out of the tournament by losing only to LCK / LPL teams? Probably, but hey it will be nice to win for once.

I have more data using dummy team by team win rates, trying to simulate closer to what will happen. I got to these win rates by working backwards from the outright winning odds, and trial and error with win rates until the output matched the outright. Perhaps I’ll go in depth of it, that’s for another post though. Here are some interesting things I learned, bare in mind the accuracy relies on the quality of the input, and it’s impossible to know the true odds before teams play.

1) In Swiss the average rank difference between teams in games is smaller than Groups, by approximately 1.1. Meaning we get more competitive matches. Groups has far more completely one sided matchups.

2) Over 72% of scenarios had 2 or more LEC/LCS/VCS teams advancing

3)  Only 1.3% of scenarios had 0 LEC/LCS/VCS teams advancing, so 98.7% had at least 1.",PandoranHuman,1697656948.0,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17ayyrq/why_the_swiss_format_is_the_wests_true_hope_this/

I recently took climbing in ranked serious this season and getting to Plat 4 75 LP at peak with a 57% WR. In previous seasons I would just 1 trick in ranked to get a feel for how the game should be played. I began to focus on map awareness, wave management, and overall not tilting.

new,The Stats we don't see,"Hi all,

So I'm writing this in the hopes Riot will consider implementing so additional information regarding how effective items are. Currently most items show how much additional healing, shielding, damage etc they are giving, and in some cases (Spirit Visage, Eclipse, Divine Sunderer) we can see multiple types of benefits.

Currently there are a few missing that I think would be good to see, most notably the new adc mythics are all lacking information as to their additional damage output.

Infinity Edge additional Crit damage

Navori Quickblades additional Crit damage and cd reduction

Bloodthirster additional damage and healing done

Collector number of executes and gold

Lord Dominics additional damage through % pen 

Voidstaff through additional %pen

Rylais Crystal Scepter time slowed (sec)

Cosmic Drive movement speed active (sec)

Riftmaker healing done

Shieldbow healing done

Blade of the Ruined King healing done

Ravenous Hydra healing done

Mortal Reminder damage from % pen

Guinsoos Rageblade on hit damage done, additional on hit damage done (for other items producing off this) and additional damage done from %pen

Serylda's Grudge additional damage from %pen and time slowed (sec)

Divine Sunderer additional damage from %pen

Plated Steel caps damage reduced from auto attacks

Eclipse additional damage from %pen

Runaans Hurricane additional damage from on hit damage and additional damage from on hit damage from other items

I feel adding these would give players a lot more clarity on what their items are actually doing ingame as the many already showing these details do.

I would also suggest adding additional damage from flat pen items like Sorcerer boots and Lethality items.

I'm interested if others would like to see this information. Let me know your thoughts.

new,Does League have debuffs on downrank games?,"I want to know if someone else consistently experiences this.

&amp;#x200B;

I will have games where my attacks carve through anything and everything, and i will have games were it takes 6 auto attacks to kill a minion. This happens in downrank games, where league forces a loss on you in order to keep you at a 50% winrate. In uprank games at the same game time, items and level, i will 2 hit the same minion. The same applies to champions. My most recent experience was a cait vs tristana game, where i would hit her with 6 auto attacks and she left with 95% hp, while she hit me 2 times and i walked away with &lt;25% hp. This was early game so there was no meaningful difference in abilities or items. No traps or nets were used in this engagement, only auto attacks.

Everyone keeps calling it a skill issue because its a toxic community, but when dumping 1400 damage into an adc with miss fortunes ultimate, hitting the whole thing, and the adc walking away with most of its hp, it is hardly a skill issue anymore. In games with identical item sets, levels and game times that kind of attack would completely kill the same adc. I also want to stress that the times this has happened, the adc in question always has less hp at the time than the total damage dealt by the ultimate.

&amp;#x200B;

The same thing also happens when playing master yi, where randomly my attacks will do 5x as much damage as normal, and some games they do practically nothing. I have looked into every single stat i can think of. From armor, magic resist, life steal, weird items, runes, dragon buffs etc. No matter how much i look i see no meaningful difference in characters, builds or all of the above that would explain these experiences. I hope that some of you have gone through something similar so i can finally figure this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, i wish to note this applies to everyone in my lobby. We are a 3 stack, and we all consistently experience this difference in damage output and enemy damage negation (always at the same time in the same matches). I assume many more out there have this issue and it is being attributed to a ""skill issue"" despite no change in playstyle nor build on either team.

Edit:  
Don't bother commenting if you have not experienced it. If you have nothing to add you are just taking up space. The reason for this is that this thread is not about people screaming at eachother, but rather to see if it is a widespread issue. If toxic people spam toxic comments it will drown out the meaningful content. I addressed the usual responses above so no comments repeating the same thing are needed, as the point have been made alredy.

Edit Edit:  
This is not about getting a rank. Its about consistent gameplay even in blind pick.

I want to stress as it's been mentioned in the comments, i am not talking about  Loser's Queue. I have not heard the term used before, but from what i read it is about pairing you with bad teammates.

new,Some possible champion changes,"**Kayn:**

\-  Kayn already has an indicator for his E but it shows only either his full duration length or the reduced length. While there is already an audio cue thats played when his E runs out due to not being in a wall, I think a visual clarification via an indicator could also help.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I think similarly an Out-of-Champion-Combat-Indicator could help so that you aren't suprised when you directly exit the wall . Maybe for this and the previous point there could also be an elegant solution which I don't see.

&amp;#x200B;

\- On the vision of E: I feel lt is unintuitive for enemies, that he just has a vision radius around him when inside a wall and can thus see over other walls he isn't inside off. I don't think you can see his shadowball inside the wall through FoW, so the enemies don't know that he sees them. Either walls could proberly block vision or the enemies could be notified wth eyes over their head.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  Expanding on the point of vision in E, it can be confusing for Kayn himself to understand that he doesn't get vision in bushes during E (same for Zoe Ult).  Normaly bushes you don't have vision of throw a shadow onto themselfes. However since for Kayn/Zoe during E/R bushes don't throw a shadow it looks as if you have vision inside, even though you don't.  I understand that at least for kayn, if bushes would throw shadows his vision inside some walls would get severely nerfed,  but one could also try to implement that the bushes don't apear as bright.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rammus/Nunu:**

\- It would be great if you could cast Predator while using powerball/biggest snowball ever! without canceling the effect

\- same for the ARAM summoner spell mark

&amp;#x200B;

**Aphelios:**

\- make E castable while dead, so that I can think about gun rotations while dead. And maybe add the weapon symbol to the notification so that its quicker to see. Additionally let it display offhand amunition while dead (or maybe let us cast w while dead instead? idk)

\- release an legendary/ultimate skin where aphelios talks instead of alune (money hack$$$)

&amp;#x200B;

**Janna:**

\- let Janna use E during her R channel

&amp;#x200B;

**Jayce:**

\- make his melee E less buggy. Knockback away from Jayce in the correct direction.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hecarim:**

\- give him one emote, where he does a pesade/levade while neighing. Could even do it at the start of his E?

&amp;#x200B;

The following points might be more controversal and I'm not sure if I want them changed myself, they are just ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fiddlesticks:**

\- remove the unintended R-W-F combo

**Jarvan IV:**

\- adjust his manacosts, so that he is not completly troll in lane.

**Senna:**

\- max her range at 100 souls. Still gain additional AD from further souls.

**Zilean:**

\- just remove the clunky passive and give only him passively bonus exp

new,Correction: Post bracket draw (Getting through the Worlds Swiss Stage without ever beating LPL/LCK),"In the last post, I accidently used the wrong version of the code; I really should stop naming these things COPIUM\_1\_1\_1. I was watching the Divephoria episode and pretty much had an 'oh shit' moment when I realized. I apologize for putting out incorrect information; that post has been deleted and I am posting this because I don't like bad information floating around because of me, so sorry again for multiple posts. 

After the round one bracket draw there is a  **63.6 % chance** that at least one Western team makes it out of the Swiss stage without ever beating an Eastern team. The chance for two teams is **\~.07%.** The very small hopium chance of three is gone. 

After looking more deeply at potential first round draws, the 'bad' first round draw ends up not being too bad, because after this round we're getting a round of East vs. East and West vs. West matchups. Round two draws end up not mattering as much for the same reason. The biggest swings in probability were in Round 3 and onward draws.

new,Easy Tweak Champs for Jungle,"As 13.20 and now 13.21 patches have shown with the changes to Morgana, Zyra, and Brand, Riot is trying to broaden the number of champs who are jungle viable, even nerfing other parts of their kit slightly after the buffs required for jungle.

I think that there is some low-hanging fruit that Riot is missing out on, and I was wondering what others people had. Champions who could jungle with minor tweaks, feel different to play than current junglers, and would be healthy for the game as a whole.

Cho'gath: All he needs is an increase in his monster cap on his E. At rank 1 the 3% max health damage caps at a measly 60 damage - which even slows down his first clear as the level 1 buffs have 2.3k health (without the cap he'd do 9 more damage per E - 27 more damage per cast) while the caps are really designed to prevent champs from taking down objectives too quick. While Cho's ult is great during smite fights, the more common tank build is actually really bad at taking down objectives quickly. (Most of his damage comes from ult &amp; % health on his E)

A change on his cap from 60+20/rank to maybe 100+20/stack would speed up his first couple clears to be semi-competitive (still on the slow side) and average at objectives. Nothing else in his kit would need to change.

I think Cho'gath jungle would be healthy for the game since while he has 3 CCs and an execute, his lack of gap-closers (or any movement) keeps him from being too annoying to play against when 2/3 of his CCs and his execute are close-range and the third is telegraphed. (Unlike if Lissandra was made a viable jungler as Phreak mentioned.)

new,Why are we not using cool features from other (Riot) games into League ?,"In the past few weeks me and a few friends been dabbling into some other games, and came into our attention on why games like League Wild Rift and Dota 2, have features like:   


* More in depth player/champion stats
* Pre-game item purchase
* Character/skin 3d model visualization
* Map/rift customization
* Better player profile customization
* Custom announcer packs

But PC League has a lackluster version of these or not even even that.   


Wild Rift that is made by Riot, has really cool looking animated and interactive champion 3d models that you can examine, but this is non existent on PC League. Dota 2 customization of your game is miles ahead of league, with custom VO for announcers (rn during the international they have several announcer packs from casters, and community members from different regions to purchase), map skins, UI skins, custom profile layouts, and so on. And the amount of stats data that you can access in Dota 2 is immense in comparison.  


I'm aware that league has way more pressing issues with its service/client that need to be addressed first (for example, it's been almost 800 days and the BR server still has account transfers blocked). But my question is:   


With the large amount of funding that Riot has, enough to fund multiple games (Wild Rift, Legends of Runeterra, TFT, League Stories Games, Project L, League MMO, etc), Hollywood level production of shows (Arcane, Arcane Season 2), Musical productions with several famous artists (Lil Nas X, New Jeans, Twice, G-Idle, Imagine Dragons, etc), then why? When it comes to its main core game, they seem to not add new features (its taken multiple years for them to allow us to choose a different language of the client in League, this is coming in November), QoL and customization stuff that Riot themselves implemented to its other games under the same IP?

They slowed the game down so much that even useless overnerfed champs like Aurelion Sol that loses to everyone in lane is getting nerfed. Where does this leave early game champions like Talon, that were already weak before this patch, and are now even more terrible?",bxgang,1697648284.0,0,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17avkff/riot_ruined_the_game_by_nerfing_early_game_too/

new,"DK Kellin: ""Worlds scrims are going really well"" (+ other player interviews)","Earlier today Dplus Kia released a 30 min video on their Youtube page ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1aj5BCCvcI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1aj5BCCvcI)) with pretty lengthy interviews / video clips with each player. I think EN translations are delayed until next week but here are some highlights:

4:30 - DK players submitting Worlds pick'em

* Canyon: ""who will get the most penta kills... who did you guys pick?""
* Showmaker: ""I picked Deft, we have to give him a penta"" (Deft never got a penta in his entire LCK or Worlds career)
* Deft: ""wow if I get a penta at Worlds...""
* Canyon: ""But I picked Ruler...""
* Showmaker: ""Ah sh-...."" (to Deft) ""He said he picked Ruler, really? We could even run into JDG...!""
* Deft: ""OK well I'm voting for Kanavi now!""

5:40 - question is ""did you ever think there was a chance you would not qualify for Worlds?""

* Deft: ""When Summer Split ended we were in a really worrying situation, but Playoffs scrims went really well so after that I felt like we would make Worlds 100%""
* Kellin: ""Yeah we overcame a lot of issues during playoffs and now **Worlds scrims are also going super well**""
* Deft: ""I feel like we got a lot ""closer"" during in game comms later in the season. IRL we were always pretty friendly from the start but it took some time to get that same closeness in game, for example if a teammate makes a mistake, they aren't so worried now about how other teammates might react in game""

8:25 - excerpts of in game comms during scrims

* Kellin: ""Canna don't worry, bot lane is over, we're good""
* Showmaker: ""\[Canna\] if you can just group and be a warm body we can win""
* Canna: ""I'm not sure if I can even do that lol""
* Showmaker: ""Yes you can LOL... our top wave state does make me want to quit the game though""
* (I think eventually enemy team FF'ed the scrim)

18:18 - question is ""how is the team spirit now?""

* Showmaker: ""After Regional Finals the team morale has been really good. I would say, Worlds is a really fun experience - compared to LCK there's a lot more nerves and a lot more at stake. We've all been to Worlds before, and in order to reproduce \[for Canyon/Deft/SM\] that amazing feeling when you win Worlds, everyone is giving extra effort and I think that's contributing to the team spirit.""
* Canna: ""I think our team synergy has improved a lot, like we're better at matching each other's picks and creating a cohesive team comp now""
* Canyon: ""We've been playing together for like 8 months now, so I think our teamwork is really good at this point""
* Deft: ""I also feel like our drafts are a lot cleaner now than they were in early season""

21:36 -

* Interviewer: ""So Worlds is the last time the 5 of you will be playing together...""
* Showmaker: ""Ye-- but we could still play together next year...! The last time...? Well it's true, I've been at DK for my whole career but I don't know what will happen next year. It could even be my last Worlds, who knows \[he said this lightly don't take it too seriously...!\] All of my teammates, coaching staff, front office staff and everyone else are really good people, and I really want to do well at worlds to pay them back for their constant support""

24:55 - not sure what the question was

* Showmaker: ""I do watch foreign leagues - mostly LPL + LEC. Those leagues have a lot more fights, like when my teammates and I are watching we'll go 'what? they're really going for \*this\* fight?'

25:30 - is there a player or team you're looking forward to seeing at worlds?

* Deft: ""There's this player named Canyon - he tells me jungle feels stronger than previous patches and I think he's an exceptionally good player so I'm looking forward to see what he can do this Worlds. In terms of teams, JDG won MSI, and they also have players who performed well at Asian Games, so I'm looking forward to seeing them.""
* Showmaker: ""At Worlds, the player I'm looking forward to watching is **myself**.""
* Kellin: ""I want to play against JDG Ruler. I don't think I've ever won against him so I want to win this time around.""

30:00 - Showmaker the comedian

* Interviewer: ""What is the name of this documentary again?""
* Showmaker: ""It's ""Be the One"" right?""
* Interviewer: ""No it's ""We are One...""""
* Showmaker: ""Oh, so if we win Worlds the name of that documentary can be ""We Won"" right?""",lawfulkitten1,1697647688.0,176,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17avby3/dk_kellin_worlds_scrims_are_going_really_well/

new,Finding Palafox's Genius in his KR Solo Queue Data (and why NRG beats Weibo tomorrow),"Hi, I'm Jack J! I work full-time on ""AI in competitive gaming"" and so have access to a lot of solo queue data. Today I decided to write an article for one simple purpose:

**Finding NRG Palafox's Genius in his KR Solo Queue Data**

Tomorrow (19th October 2023) the LCS Champions, NRG, face the LPL 4th seed, Weibo Gaming, in the first round of the League of Legends World Championship.

It’s far too easy to be an NA doomist, I mean, given their record and all. However, sometimes, all you need is a little hope. Today that hope has come in the form of an off-hand comment by XiaoHu, the Wiebo mid-laner, who described Palafox, his opposite number in NRG, as “powerful, and seems like a genius”.

Yes, this was later more accurately translated to be closer to “talented with potential”, but, as I say: today is all about spreading the hopium.

Now, I won’t be jumping immediately to “and so NRG will probably win Worlds”. Instead, I’m simply going to try and fuel the fire. My fuel, in this case, is a s##t tonne of Korean Solo Queue data, alongside a desire to answer a very simple question; what makes Palafox a genius?

Before we get into the detail, here’s a quick explanation of the data.

**Data Preliminaries**

* All data comes from **Korean Solo Queue**.
* A special thank you to [TrackingThePros](https://www.trackingthepros.com/) who provide me with the solo queue account names.
* I am writing this on the **18th October**, the data on the site below refreshes regularly and so will therefore not match exactly.
* Statistics are calculated from the players last **50 games**, to be best reflective of their current elo.
* All statistics are **adjusted by the players Champion pool**. They are therefore reflective of the player and how they perform above or below the average for their Champions.
* When quoting **percentiles**, they are being **compared** to all **Master+ accounts**, not just other professional players.
* **Kills/Deaths in the last 10 seconds of a game (fountain dives, mostly) are removed**, as to not punish regular for-fun fountain diving. Therefore, some games will not match **exactly** what is quoted in a player’s match history.
* You can see all data here: [iTero Korean Solo Queue Statistics](https://www.itero.gg/pro-statistics)

Now, on with the question. What makes Palafox a genius?

I have over 500 statistics to deal with, but to start let us keep it simple. He currently sits at a respectable 766LP, from an impressive 441 games. This puts him ahead of his lane opponent, but admittedly he’s had a few more games to get there.

[LP and Games in KR Solo Queue 2023](https://preview.redd.it/kbioqcd2dzub1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b101d5dbc73ae1c2532b2f714d91815cd3e06b6)

His Champion Pool is also, by most comparisons, fairly normal. No sign of his genius just yet.

[Palafox's recent Champion Pool](https://preview.redd.it/cabxdf7bdzub1.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31fc5403df56d8c13683200cc9fdea9e3156f5f3)

Having spent the last hour studying his Solo Queue data in an almost stalkerish level of detail, there was one theme that stood out among all others.

**Palafox is the KDA King.**

[ Overall KDA](https://preview.redd.it/i8ye5jfedzub1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55df5f6430152fb5acfda7159456689ca91b824f)

(Remember, all stats are adjusted by the Champion Pool. His “raw” average is lower, but he constantly over-performs on KDA when compared to other high ranked players who play similar Champions!)

There were several components that make-up his overall KDA that stood-out to me:

* KDA against his Lane Opponent
* KDA in the Jungle/River (and the impact on objective control)
* KD in Solo Bolos

## KDA against his Lane Opponent

[Kills + Assists on Mid-Laners](https://preview.redd.it/auej9nihdzub1.png?width=497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61249e5ec9295fa803452b40f3af9272e6780d0e)

Let’s start with his Kills + Assists against mid-laners. Although he’s in the bottom third of the elo (since solo queue mavericks tend to play riskier than pros), he remains competitive with more comparable opponents like G2 Caps and XiaoHu - Faker being an outlier for his passiveness in lane.

His genius, however, may best be seen when you use the above in conjunction with his Deaths to mid-laners.

[Deaths to Mid-Laners](https://preview.redd.it/090jpn5ldzub1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce29ff3f7663a7f73c2b3beda5e29093594882e0)

XiaoHu is killing mid-laners at a rate of 3.3 a game, but dying to them at the exact same rate, whilst Caps is even dying more than he kills them! Palafox manages to get 3.4 kills or assists a game on his fellow mid-laners, whilst only dying to them 2.3 times. A master class in controlled aggression.

**KDA in the Jungle &amp; River**

The second component is his KDA specifically whilst inside the jungle and river. Usually these happen during team fights and skirmishes around key objectives like Heralds and Dragons.

[KDA in the Jungle + River](https://preview.redd.it/054bdd0odzub1.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40776538c72759ba162891df05a5f565f57dc65c)

For this one, I use a slightly different statistic than normal. Rather than looking at a KDA Ratio, I instead add up all his Kills + Assists in the Jungle, and take away his Deaths.

The conclusion is really self-explanatory; Palafox seems to just be better than XiaoHu at team fights in the jungle. I really can’t be budged on this conclusion, sorry.

You may also be wondering; given his absolute dominance in jungle team fighting, do his teams tend to secure more Dragons and Heralds:

[Net Dragons &amp; Net Barons](https://preview.redd.it/6v0mohz0ezub1.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebd0612340b191ecd96759c23e2fa47c7c8b2443)

Again, I use a slightly different metric here. Rather than looking at the raw amount of Monsters killed, I look at the net value. If your team takes it, you get +1, if the enemy takes it you get -1, and if no one took it you get 0.

*Data Note: I include Dragons/Heralds that the player did not directly assist with, since there are plenty of ways of helping your team secure an objective without needing to be directly involved.*

With Palafox’s exceptional jungle team fighting he is able to help his team secure Dragons and Heralds far above the average, and certainly above XiaoHu!

**Solo-Bolo KD Differential**

As our final statistic, let us now look at how many Solo-Bolos he averages per game, and how that compares to his Solo-Bolo deaths.

[Solo Bolos KDs](https://preview.redd.it/7hktw6k3ezub1.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c3ae835a279ac1419b06be940a61af471b21c7)

If you look closely at the table, you can quite quickly see that NRG are going to beat Weibo tomorrow. At this point, it’s a mathematical fact. XiaoHu is only managing 1.39 Solo Kills a game but is getting Solo Killed 1.27 times? Our boy Palafox not only manages to get MORE Solo Kills (1.48), he’s also doing it whilst being Solo Killed considerably less (0.81)!

**To Conclude**

Through my research and writing of this brief Solo Queue analysis I have become increasingly confident that NRG will be beating Weibo tomorrow. This will come almost exclusively through an absolute monstrous mid-gap. Which will unfold a little like this:

* XiaoHu, in a desperate attempt to show his prowess will make a number of failed plays against Palafox, who will happily take the free Kill (or Assist), whilst safely farming his lane.
* Around the 8-10 minute mark, both teams will collapse around Herald where NRG will emerge victorious after an almost flawless team fight from their mid-laner.\*huffs the last tin of copium\*
* Although NRG are ahead at this point, it’s not until a monstrous Solo Bolo from Palafox onto XiaoHu and the subsequent Baron does the game become a complete one-sided stomp, followed by a 27-minute final push.

*All statistics in this article are true and factual as of 18th October, the additional commentary may contain traces of /s.*

By the way, this can't be classed as biased; I'm European.",JackWills94,1697643804.0,469,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17attjm/finding_palafoxs_genius_in_his_kr_solo_queue_data/
new,"Phreak on Seraphine changes: ""if this is neutral on winrate this is a midlane-skewed buff and an APC nerf."" ""More of her power will be in her solo lane,"" and W changes are ""the only real nerf to the kit.""","In his [most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spXs6ufs3Kk) Phreak explained his rationale behind the Seraphine changes and why they're not a death knell for Seraphine mains. I've transcribed some of the video and emphasized some key lines.

## Disparity between roles:
[38:18] 
&gt; [Mid and support] winrates are 0.1% apart—they are the exact same power level and despite having the exact same power level, support Seraphine pickrate is **sixteen times** midlane Seraphine pickrate.  

&gt; We can't really in good conscience buff a  53% winrate champion who's got a respectable pickrate, especially in high ELO where players optimize for winrate and thus pick a really, really high winrate AP champion. **I think bot lane carry Seraphine can be 51, 52%, that's fine.**

 [40:25] 
&gt; We decided to say ""okay, let's bring botlane Seraphine (who's way up here)...and support Seraphine is down here and let's bring their power levels together; let's have bot Seraphine and support Seraphine have roughly the same power level; that would be nice."" And as a side goal, if we can make Seraph midlaner better, that's nice, but it's also so incredibly unpopular: it has less that half the pickrate of *jungle Teemo*, for example—its pickrate is near-identical to that of Zyra jungle, and Zyra jungle is a 46% winrate jungler.

&gt; There's just not that much of a market for Seraphine mid, and so in terms of serving the sixteen times the number of players who clearly want to play Seraphine support and the 1/16th that number of players who don't play Seraphine mid, we say we're going to serve the sixteen times more players, and we have to compensate botlane.

[55:35] 
&gt; It's also worth noting that the entire suite of changes is *midlane* skewed; if this is in sum total neutral on winrate, this is a midlane-skewed buff and a botlane APC-skewed nerf.
&gt; ... if less of her power is in the absolutely absurd levels of healing from her W, this means more of her power is in her solo lane self-reliant power budget such as my shield is stronger/has a lower cooldown and my Q does more damage on a lower cooldown, so [the W changes are] midlane skewed, or rather a nerf to everything *but* midlane. Now, of course, teamfight output is of course weaker, to be fair; W2 is very clearly the best spell to echo. It's not even close; this skill is so overpowered, this is where basically all her power is.

&gt; **Our internal read on winrate magnitude is that this overall set of changes that we're still going through is about 0.5% winrate positive to botlane Seraphine and about 3% winrate positive to support Seraphine.** I'm a little skeptical, because I think [the W] nerf is very, very, very, very large, and I'm kind of relying on it to eat the entire power budget of everything else going on in this changelist because everything else is power-positive, and it's like, okay, this is the only line of a real nerf in the kit.

 [1:00:40] 
&gt; What's the overall result going to be for this champion? It's hard to say. **I think very strongly that support Seraphine is going to be quite a bit better; I think bot Seraphine will roughly tread water. I actually have reason to believe that mid Seraphine will gain winrate right here**; I think she will gain less than support Seraphine gains because the Q is so aggressively skewed towards support builds and not as aggressively good for AP builds, but there is definitely a chance that Seraphine is just busted next patch, and of course there also is the chance to get the numbers wrong and she sucks. And if she sucks, we buff the champion, but **the primary goal is to basically lower the gap between bot Seraphine and support Seraphine because we're not allowed to buff Seraphine in any role because bot Seraphine is too OP**. So we play up her level scaling, we play down her gold scaling, we play up her enchanter tendencies, we play down a little bit her group tendencies, and maybe we get to close the gap between botlane and mid and support, and that would be great because ti would be great to have her viable at all three roles.  
&gt; It's been a pipe dream so far; we've always been constrained by mid Seraphine being OP and support Seraphine sucked and then bot Seraphine's OP and support Seraphine sucked, and now it would be nice if we got all three. I'm not holding my breath, but that's the goal.

## Q changes:

 [47:11] 
&gt; Q is getting a shorter cooldown ranks one through four; it is getting more base damage ranks two through five and a better AP ratio at rank one, the same AP ratio at rank two, and a worse ratio rank three, four, and five. Now, remember what I said earlier about games ending on average with enough gold for three items.  
...Master Seraphine gets 6.5% less gold across their game than silver Seraphine botlane, which is to say it's much more likely that low elo Seraphine actually finishes three items than masters+ Seraphine finishes three items.  
...The rational thought is that Q is strictly stronger at rank one, strictly stronger at rank two, strictly stronger at rank three, strictly stronger at rank four, and then stronger at rank five from minutes nine through twenty-seven, until you finish Seraph's Embrace. **Do not let anyone tell you the Seraphine changes are a nerf because they are not, they pretty much can't be.** There is a part of time where the spell is weaker that is paid for by the first 25 minutes being stronger and that means that by her being stronger at winning 1v1s and getting lane priority and winning teamfights and securing objectives and killing turrets pays for more ability power to further offset where she would be weaker in a real game, the acute changes are a strict buff to Seraphine.  
...**Q is strictly buffed; it is more buffed for support than for a farm lane, but it is overall buffed for the champion, no ifs ands or buts. Q change is a strict buff to Seraphine. If this was the only change, she would gain winrate in every single role she plays. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise; they're wrong.**

## W changes:

[53:14] 
&gt; By having the shield go up per rank and the cooldown go down per rank and (though the rank one ability mana cost goes up) the mana cost per rank goes down, there are three levers here that all say maxing W is better than it was before. It's worth noting that, again, because support Seraphine does not get a lot of ability power, maxing Q is also better than before, so we'll see which way they go, but it is going to be a lot of power to support Seraphine in both of those cases. 
&gt; ...I'm believing pretty strongly we should never get anywhere close to Sona's level of cooldown. Spamming W on a short cooldown feels more like Sona's sort of thing and so leaving this a as a relatively long cooldown because it does shield your entire team and can be doublecasted for minimum 300 shield to your team *before* AP ratio—that's a lot of power, that's a way shorter cooldown, and actually more shielding than Karma E, so we have to be pretty respectful here. This can get way too powerful way too fast.
&gt; The final change to W as compensation is a pretty significant nerf to the heal of a repeat-cast W, so not only is the base heal going down by 2% missing health at all ranks, but also the AP ratio is going away entirely; there is no longer an AP ratio on the W.

## E changes:

 [59:16] 
&gt; The [E changes] are strictly midlane buffs; E cost per rank goes down from ten per rank to five per rank, and the E damage is [...] a meaningful damage increase at max rank: +60 max rank, so it's fifteen damage per rank up. So if you get to that lategame mid Seraphine scenario where you finally have more ability power, you finally finish the third item even though the game ended the moment you finish the third item, congratulations, E does more damage now and makes up for your damage in front of Q. So again, she's just a stronger mage than before. The up-to-60 extra damage on E (of course that is very late in the game and often not reached) but even the +15 at level 14 is easily reached [...] this is basically a freebie midlane lever to say ""hey, her level scaling is probably going to be a bit better now."" It's much harder for bot and support Seraphine to get the later levels.",HeirToGallifrey,1697643679.0,824,367,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17atrth/phreak_on_seraphine_changes_if_this_is_neutral_on/

new,MAD Hylissong reflects on grinding SoloQ,"# 1.)Getting flamed in SoloQ:

*Interviewer:* 

You have a special playstyle and like to limit test a lot. Do you ever get flamed or inted by your team in SoloQ?

*Hylissong:*

Oh yeah, it happens a lot. You have teammates, who go play like 50 games a day, then they're just burned out. They feel like I am inting, but they don't say it, because they are chat restricted, right? So they bait ping me instead.

They don't feel like I am doing anything right and I don't feel like they want to play with me or something so I just roam and make plays happen.And it turns into a vicious cycle.

""This cycle is very exhausting and not productive.""

&amp;#x200B;

# 2.)Dealing with toxicity:

*Interviewer:*

Do you ever flame back or how do you deal with this kind of toxicity?

*Hylissong:*

I usually mute and ignore them. Sometimes I'll add them and I'll tell them something, and they react the wrong way. But that's on me because I didn't choose the right moment, especially if they were emotional post-game,but it's completely understandable and normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 3.) Difference between Pro and Non-pro schedule:

*Interviewer:* 

When you became a pro, how did your schedule change?

*Hylissong:*

When I became pro there was a planned schedule on what I should be doing throughout the day: when I am playing solo queue, when I am having fun, when I am going for dinner, when I am having gym, and when I am having review — all these things planned. 

It's not spamming games all day long, and then you feel like crap going to bed and then the next day is exactly the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 4.)Benefit of a pro schedule:

*Interviewer:*

Do you see any benefits following the schedule?

*Hylissang:*

I would say so. After one bad thing goes wrong, it's not like, ""Oh my god..."" My mental is very stable, strong, and I'm also good mechanically right now. I can say that's because of the things I now do before the day starts, the more balanced schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5.) SoloQ advice for beginners

*Interviewer:*

Do you have any advice for people, who can't get out of elo hell?

*Hylissong:*

Play champions you personally like — kind of your pocket picks, so that's probably it. And yeah, also try not to dwell on negative thoughts during the game. Instead, be more about having fun and reviewing things if they go south, not just ignoring them. So, just focus on having a good time and not ending the day hating yourself or your teammates. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Interviewer:* 

Thank you for the interview!

new,"LPL fans, how do you stay so confident about the region?","Okay trust me the title doesn't say the full picture of my thoughts. I'm a LPL fan, and I do think LPL should be the slight favorites for this Worlds because of this insane JDG team, and great LPL summer split. But I think I'm unlike other LPL fans, that I'm not confident about the overall LPL showing at all. And this is because of the swiss stage. A LPL team implodes in Worlds every single goddamn year, and I'm honestly getting a bit traumatized by it. Feels like ever since 2020, every LPL team gets rated highly coming into Worlds but 1 or 2 teams shit the bed in group stage, while LCK gets every team in quarters. I'm tired of this expectation just to feel depressed in group, this year swiss stage so I'm fully expecting WBG and one of BLG/LNG to not make it at this point. If they all do, I'll be very pleasantly surprised and happy but I'm not expecting it. 

But once LPL reaches the knockout stage, I'm very confident in them. I thought that EDG could genuinely win vs DK when they were huge underdogs, I thought RNG were as good as T1, when the 18-0 T1 roster was considered by fans to be the greatest roster ever.

The crazy thing is that I think LPL has a much higher chance of winning worlds than actually getting all 4 teams into knockout stage. The scrims rumor so far support this happening again as well. I'm not one of those ppl who think scrims don't matter, well its fair if you do. But the current scrim rumor is that the best scrim teams are all LCK teams and JDG+G2. All LCK teams and the chinese 1st seed in semis has happened for the last 2 years, albeit due to different reasons such as CN vs CN in quarters and FPX drama but it doesn't inspire confidence.

So, LPL fans how do you stay so confident? I need some of that copium, I think western fans were the ones that needed copium but I need some rn. I'll not be happy if its the JDG and LCK show, and JDG wins worlds.",katareky,1697639776.0,3,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17asbh8/lpl_fans_how_do_you_stay_so_confident_about_the/
new,Varus Q Change," I just played my first Varus game of the patch so I didn't notice sooner that they snuck in change for Varus' Q indicator that was not mentioned in the patch notes. Together with the range indicator there is now also a projectile indicator. Normally I don't really mind those kinds of changes but this indicator is really really distracting to me because you have to channel the spell and it's there for the full duration. Like I said things like this normally don't bother me but this is quite a bad ""QoL"" change in my opinion. It doesn't look that bad in the picture but when you play the champ it just feels so off and distracting. Maybe there is a chance they revert it, if not this is actually a thing that sadly would make me not want to play Varus.

Recently Kha'Zix, who is struggling in the jungle, had their buffs seemingly pulled from the upcoming patch with no reason given.

It's just odd, as someone else pointed out, that people like Phreak who are known for giving super detailed reasoning behind changes made, big or small, has been super vague and basically just said ""jungle op so we nerf"" as reasoning for such a huge change to an entire role.

new,"[SATIRE] It's good that Riot has finally addressed Seraphine support and given her buff removing her pointless midlane! It's so good, in fact, that I think it's time to nerf Swain mid and buff support - the ACTUAL role players want him in!","Hello besties, as you may know, Riot is buffing Seraphine support. As part of these changes, they are reducing her scaling and giving her more early power - which is like, you know, kinda against her ""hyperscaling fantasy"" buuuuut I can accept it a bit so long as we remain a scaling champ. BUT, Phreak has clearly outlined that they are fine if Seraphine mid stops existing as collateral damage, since she has a super low &lt;0.50% PR in most elos so basically non-existant already.

HO-HO-HOEWEVER, I think this is a good moment to address the elephant in the room: **SWAIN**.

Over the years, Swain support, his most loyal fanbase has gotten nothing but changes that helped midlane and top because of incessant whining from mid and top, the roles that basically had no playrate. Right now his PR is at a whooping 1% after, what, 2, 3, Jhin's funny number of mini reworks?

And THAT'S where the changes landed?

WELL NO SIR, I SAY NO SIR!

We in the support role lost our super cool ""pull whenever enemy is CC"" for these mid fans clamoring for mages to hardly even play him anyway and forcing Swain into a perpetual 50% wr of ""oh, he is viable, not super good tho"" just because they whined and now don't even want to use him? and after all this they still complain about ""oh I would totally use him, you don't get it, I ACTUALLY love Swain and wish him to be viable"" except he is right there, he is literally standing there drinking a margarita in midlane, waiting for you to come inside his loving embrace and you are just there dumbfounded saying ""nu uh"".

wtf? 

Meanwhile, Supp's playerbase has only GROWN over the years, rising to a near 5%PR because we, support chads, love our ""Draco Malphoy's dad whose name I can't remember"" looking ahh crow daddy who probably gives good hugs💅. I say if they don't want him, give it to support players again, reintroduce CC pull on ally and give him MK Scorpion's ""GET OVER HERE"" anytime he uses it.

Anyway, that's just my what I think, I am looking forward to Seraphine's changes. *The Q speed buff specially will be so awesome! Let's go Seraqueens!*

new,So what exactly are the roadblocks preventing riot from having a balanced game after 13 years?,"don't get me wrong, I'm not an expert on the subject so my opinion probably means squat, but I've been playing league for about 8 years so I at least know what some things are (or were) like. The obvious ones are:

* Meta, gotta change things to keep em fresh.
* new champions/the sheer number of champions.

but after 13 years and what, millions upon millions of dollars and you can't even come close to not having both absurdly strong and absurdly weak champions. I get it, testing the waters is a part of balance, but that's what the entire pbe is for (and for bugs of course). Look at duskblade for crying out loud! Am I expecting perfection?  no not in the slightest, i just want a decent game where I can actually play and fight the other opponent instead of it being a one-way stomp fest.

On a side note, do you think infinitely stacking champions pose a threat to balance? I'd love to hear people's thoughts on that too.

This region has brought be happiness and joy throughout the years watching it(I've watched since 2019, have only seen one LCS make it past group stage). I try not to focus too hard on the international results, but domestically LCS is arguably one of the most competitive regions out there. Don't get me wrong, C9 tends to steamroll LCS, but out of 8 splits, we have seen 5 different champions!!! I'm sure LPL has had more but I really like how ""diverse"" our region is domestically!!!

I also really like some of the players like Spica and Dhokla, and for those that don't follow LCS too deeply on twitter, the community is really awesome. Though people are now afraid or too disappointed in the LCS to show their love anymore (valid reason), the community on twitter shows so much love to the players it's really wholesome there often.

I'm not saying that LCS will win worlds anytime soon, but I legitimately like our status at worlds. We are clearly not bottom of the barrel region, and at our best(which to be fair we don't show often lol) we can take down T1, like EG did in 2022!!!(I'm sure many people forgot)

LPL Summer Split was shorter (69 days) than the waiting period,"While I generally like new Worlds format and enjoy it, it is embarrassing how awkwardly long we have to wait for the tournament this year, especially for regions like LPL. 

LPL Summer Split was started at **29th of May** on patch **13.10**, and on **30th of July** (*63 days from the start)* JDG were the first team to qualify to Worlds. On **5th of August** (*69 days*), LPL Grand Final had taken place on patch **13.13** and JDG confirmed 1st seed from China.

Tomorrow they will finally play at Worlds stage and it takes them ... **80 days** from qualification and **73 days** from Finals! More than the split was itself, we basically could have one more a complete LPL split in this window. Can't imagine how it feels for players to have such intense Spring Split, MSI and Summer playing 2-3 times per week with almost no pauses to then chill for basically 3 month to play at Worlds.

Interesting to see Ruler isn't no.1 for any of them after seeing that 80% of western analysts had Ruler as the best player in the world (often phrasing as its not close too). Also good to see Knight being 1st twice, and 2nd once after seeing many people putting knight as the 3rd best mid or as low as 5th 6th player overall.

I like this list cause it seems they are actually kinda actually basing it off performance this year (except the obvious doinb Crisp bias).

I think that if they are changing the rift they are likely or at least should consider using this new terrain type in those changes. Especially with the elemental drake map changes. Deep water from the ocean drake makes thematic sense.
To keep the purists happy, they could leave the base map still and make the drake maps more drastic and should include the deep water.

[https://worlds2023simulator.vercel.app/](https://worlds2023simulator.vercel.app/)

Its a free deployed build and quite rushed. It started off as a simple console script that I probably shouldn't have made into a web-app but here we are. Please ignore any defects and it surely could have had more features but for now it has two modes to play.

1. Randomize Results:
   1. Randomize (East Biased): In this mode the next round is generated but East always wins vs West and G2 always wins vs West.
   2. Randomize (Completely Random): Complete Chaos
2. PickEm': At any round, you are free to click and select on the outcomes for matches and ""LOCK IN"" after you select your picks.

I searched for what the [rules](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Archive:Official_Rulebooks/Riot/Worlds/2023) would be for teams to draw into matches in the following Rounds but saw that there are no additional rules so it is supposedly random?

3. Sustain is not \*stammering\* S S SUPPOSED TO BE IN THBE GAME ANYMORE - So what, shut up.
4. It will \*loudly breathing and swallows saliva\* throw off the meta - The meta is boring and sucks anyway. So what, shut up.
5. Blah blah blah \[insert any argument against bringing gunblade back next patch\] - Shut up.

Having an extra way to interact and make plays in the game via an item is 100x more fun than solely relying on your champs kit. It allowed for more brain-mode plays, and it has plenty of counterplay still. It's not an auto win item. Think of all the screaming the LCS casters can do when somebody zap kills someone. Think of the pogchamps in LCS twitch chat.

Much of the sustain the game used to have has been removed or mitigated, but I don't see how anyone can possibly find lack of sustain/healing fun. It just means that you have to go back and forth from fountain far more often, and are less able to make plays after a fight or duel. ZZZzzzzz. The heal on the item wasn't overly OP anyway. It allowed you to gradually heal back to full health after \~2 to \~4 full minion waves depending on the point in the game, and sustain a bit in lane. Example: if Kayle is vs malphite, it allows Kayle to somewhat persist in lane rather than permanently losing 1/3HP from one mindless malphite Q and having to back, or getting 1 shot ulted. (\*scoffs loudly\* AH HA HE'S A KAYLE player THAT EXPLAINS WHY HE WANTS IT BACK!!!!!1 - shhhh, be quiet).

There's apparently a trend to pull away a bit from item actives. Wow. That's so fun. Only playing in my little niche while another lane loses and having no agency or carry potential is not fun. Gunblade allows for more playmaking and opportunities to the champions that build it. It's a 3600 gold item, so it's something you have to work for as well.

Just bring it back. If it truly messes stuff up then you can get rid of it again. The game is the most straight up dead and boring grindfest it's ever been. The worst player in the game has too much agency, and matchups have too little counterplay. Giving players an item that give people more opportunities and possibilities to carry is better for everyone. Better for me. Better for you. Yes, you. Because everyone can build it. Me, you, your top, your mid, anyone that wants it. I'm going to build one right now in my garage.",detromi,1697628224.0,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17aod2a/hextech_gunblade_should_be_brought_back_it_just/

three Western and three Eastern teams at 2-2. If any Western teams draw each other (about 60%) one is guaranteed top 8. In the other case, East vs West, East vs West and East vs West, some of the best Western teams at the tournament get three opportunities to
beat some of the weaker Eastern teams at the tournament. We'll be pessimistic and say each Western team only has  around a 15% chance of winning their bo3 at 2-2 against the Eastern team. That's still  ~40% (1-0.85^3) for any Western team to win their match-up.

&amp;#x200B;

Answer yourself honestly, how often do you really pay attention to the summoner names of other players? Or even use them to communicate, instead of adressing them by the name of their champion?

From my experience, 99% of the time people use champion names or don't communcate at all and the last time I saw someone pay attention to a clever joke or refference in someone's name was probably during season 4.

Not to mention that there are a lot of player who never cared about their summoner names anway and simply used a gibbersish of letters and numbers or generic words, just to have a name and play the game.

Additionally, LoL's playerbase is so huge that running into someone with the same name as yours or someone elses is going to border on a miracle. Unless you're playing in Masters and above where player count gets really low.

There is also the topic of impersonation and use of names of people popular in the LoL community, but that has been happening for years through use of special characters and other tricks so not much is going to change. There has been a very small handful of instances of me playing aginst or with someone who I thought could be a YouTuber only to find out that they're some kid who barely speaks english and knows the most colorful combinations of racial slures in the world.

Let me start with I'm part of the sad regions that do not have normal draft. So If quick play straight up removes blind pick I will not have a ranked option on summoners rift apart from quick play. 

Im one of those players who plays fill in normals and likes to match my champ to my team comp.

 Quick play may remove this from my friend group. And we usually play as a group of 3 and 4 so playing ranked flex isn't a consistent thing to do. (I can play soloq when playing alone )

IDK), Xerath, and Vel'koz. That's eleven champions who were not originally designed as supports, or who were not originally designed to be PRIMARILY supports who have received balance changes specifically to appeal to support players and or to balance them for the lane. Including Seraphine who is slated for tweaks this upcoming patch, that makes **TWELVE** champions.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously it's a mystery to me how Ivern has managed to avoid this treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

When other champions start seeing too much play in any other lane they're almost always nerfed right away, ESPECIALLY if it is a support going into another lane. Pyke mid, Karma mid/top, Sona top (and bot!), Janna top, Seraphine bot, Camille jungle, Kalista top ETC. All of these are other examples of champions seeing viability in other lanes who were then FORCEFULLY taken out of those lanes. Why is that not okay, but Seraphine -who is an absolutely AWFUL support- gets moved into support because people decided they wanted to play her there?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I salty because Seraphine mid is (probably) effectively dead in the water next patch? Absolutely. I am a support player and honestly I'm sick of seeing random cheese show up in the role only for it to be accommodated to, but when supports show up in other roles it's almost always swifty nerfed. I mean, seriously, how many supports have undergone a lane swap that has received SERIOUS attention allowing them to stay there? Kench? Maybe Morgana jungle? Maybe Brand (his winrate is .2% higher midlane I guess, it's still sub 50%)?

&amp;#x200B;

A new support comes out and they're basically PLASTERED with little kinks that prevent them from ever seeing play in any lane other than support because the champion design team is absolutely terrified of Renata glasc making an appearance in mid lane, but they're just fine with turning every other artillery mage into a support.

They post Tier List contents every patch, although their contents are based on KR server it sure is very useful.

Champion tiers are determined based on data from the KR server tiers Emerald and above.

The criteria for selecting champion tiers is based on the champion pick rate, win rate, ban rate, counter rate, and data in high elo rank comprehensively. A pick rate of over 0.5% is required to be in the tier list.

Let's start at Top. If you look at the Tier 1 lineup, you'll be taken aback.

Aatrox Darius Fiora Yone Jax, all five champions are tricky to play against. We'll only be able to ban one of them, and I'd probably ban Aatrox.

Obviously, the champion that top players have been talking about a lot lately would be **Yone, Jax, and his friends.**

**Aatrox** has a 13.7% pick rate and a 50.4% win rate, looking like a safe first pick champ, and able to take the initiative easily. Compared to the last patch, he's lost a bit of momentum. What we've expected for Top this patch is that champions will decline due to nerfs such as Conqueror and Grasp of the Undying-based champions are going to have a chance, and he wasn’t able to get out of the woods 100%. **He's still a good first pick champ, but not a free-for-all pick**

We mentioned that Grasp of the Undying-based champions got a chance this patch. A prime example is **Fiora. With a 7% pick rate and a 50.8% win rate**, she made it into Tier 1. We've seen some improvements in her power curve, where her first-core timing, which was a bit elusive, has been improved. It's also a good enough card against Aatrox, Yone, and Jax.

If you go higher up in rank, only Darius gets down from Tier 1 and **Rumble** seems to be taking over, So it's like the top players' preferences are almost somewhat the same. However, Rumble is a difficult pick to use properly unless you're in Master tier or higher.

On the other hand, **Jax**'s data is yet again going astray. The changes to the motions this patch have made him smoother to deal damage, And we've seen tiers rise despite a bug that will eventually hurt him. At tiers Emerald and above, we aren’t sure if the win rate changes based on proficiency, And it's not until you get to tiers Master and above that the pick rate is 16.3% and the win rate is 51.2%. At the end of the day, we don't think Jax’s tier went up because his damage increased, or because his durability got too good, But instead we think it's more of an increase in convenience than anything else. So we think it's fair to say that it's only going to rate well for more skilled players. But like we said beforehand, it's also a patch version that champions using Grasp of the Undying have a chance at, So Jax is a good pick right now.

**Jungle. This is the position that really got sniped this patch,** And here's Tier 1, with a total of five champs; Graves Lee Sin Karthus Rammus Nidalee. 

**Graves is on a roll right now, up 11 spots to the top rankings.** If AD junglers know when to utilize Doran’s Blade And this becomes more widespread, we may be able to see a more interesting power balance between junglers. For now, Graves is showing off selfish stats, and as of today, he’s got close to a **25% pick rate**. And his **ban rate** is quickly **exceeding 20%.**  And yet, his win rate is creeping upwards to the point where it negates this disastrous pick rate increase. The Youmuu's buff this patch has really helped Graves, And the changes to the jungle as a whole didn't really impact Graves at all, so he’s relatively more powerful than before. 

Champions like Graves, Karthus, and Nidalee who don't get affected as hard by the jungling changes or even Briar and Ivern at the top of Tier 2 are in a relatively better situation. In the case of **Ivern**, his **pick rate** is actually still **low at 1.8**%, but his **win rate** is still in the **54% range**. On the other hand, as we pointed out at Top, the late game value is good. 

**Champs** who struggled in solo queue due to **weak jungling are getting another chance**. **Rammus has a 5.5% pick rate and a 53.5% win rate**, and **Maokai has a 7.1% pick rate and a 52% win rate.** These guys are prime examples. Instead, you need to have really good late game value. Unless you have outstanding late game value, you're still going to be held back by your jungling ability. It has to be almost as strong **as the power graph** you're looking at right now, with **a late game win rate of over 55%.**

**Sylas Jungle is an interesting case.** We were wondering if it would no longer be a thing after this patch because **jungling is so hard.** Sylas Jungle itself is still **hard to play this patch, but not unplayable**. We think **he’s defending his data as other champs have received more damage. He has a 6.9% pick rate and a 49.6% win rate.**

&amp;#x200B;

For the mid lane, we’ve also picked **five Tier 1 champs Sylas Orianna Taliyah Irelia Akali.**

Surprisingly, **Akshan did get a nerf this patch** and he’s been on a downward spiral. But it's amazing that he's managed to stay on the edge of Tier 1. He's truly a solo queue champion. He has a **3.5% pick rate and a 52.4% win rate.**

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/lol.ps\/champ\/517](https://preview.redd.it/pra5oba6dwub1.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e3c9011977678afea9191502640876c172ceb4a)

**We'll give the OP mark to Sylas.** He has a **pick rate of 13.4% and a win rate of 50.5%**, and he's a champion who should be difficult to pick first but nevertheless. He's also playing a lot of different runes, so we think he needs to be lit up more. We'll try to put together a Sylas featurette video soon. From runes to items and playstyles, we bet you have a lot of questions.

**Naafiri and Neeko**, even though they're **in Tier 2**, are champions with **very high win rates**. We’ll keep it simple and just go over their performance stats. **Naafiri has a 2.7% pick rate and a 53.6% win rate**, while **Neeko has a 2.5% pick rate and a 52.9% win rate.** The difference between the two is that **Naafiri's pick rate has been increasing recently**, While **Neeko's pick rate is going down**. But **they are both good picks.** **Yone is in Tier 2 with a 12.7% pick rate and a 48.5% win rate**. He has the **second highest pick rate at mid after Sylas**.

&amp;#x200B;

**After the AD LeBlanc, Statikk Shiv nerf, the devs gave a nudge to go back to AP,** And they said the compensation patch at the time worked for LeBlanc on AP items, so no additional buffs were needed. Immediately after the nerf, we were told that the Statikk Shiv LeBlanc’s data was chipping away at her stats as a whole. We're really close to the AP build now, and LeBlanc is still struggling with a 5% pick rate and 45.8% win rate. Moving up to tiers Diamond and above, he has a 4.5% pick rate and 47.3% win rate, At Master and above a 4.4% pick rate and 44.7% win rate, and and Bronze to Platinum a 5.1% pick rate and 45.4% win rate. Yes. **LeBlanc is very difficult to use at any tier right now**, and she's still getting picked. **As the developers have said, we wonder if they’ll give us another LeBlanc buff.**

&amp;#x200B;

There are more honey champs than usual since it’s after a big patch. We'll give **Ezreal an OP mark. 27.5% pick rate, 51.5% win rate, a dominant performance.** No matter how untrustworthy he’s been at Worlds, **No other ADC is as good as Ezreal in solo queue.** Considering that the recently-gone-viral unlimited stacks full AS Jinx has a 29.4% pick rate and a 50% win rate, You can see how Ezreal is putting up right now.

The viral champion **Jinx** has made it to **Tier 1**. As of today, she has a **35% pick rate,** and her **ban rate is approaching 20%**. The next patch will include a nerf to Jinx's passive stack. But regardless, it's fun, and users will want to experience how dope it is, So ADC players might still lean towards Jinx.

The **buffed Ziggs is doing a great job at bot**. We’re still cautious about recommending Ziggs Mid, But Ziggs Bot has definitely become a viable joker pick. **He's got a 3.5% pick rate and a 53.7% win rate**, and as of today, he's even gone above the 5% pick rate. Maybe without the turret plate gold nerf, he Ziggs Bot meta might have been fully established. It's still pretty good as it is though. He's got to the point where there's no bot champion with a win rate disadvantage.

One champion to watch is Armor Pen Miss Fortune, who is seeing a resurgence with the Youmuu’s buff. Her pick rate is slightly up from the previous patch, but she doesn't seem to be getting much attention. The value of Miss Fortune leading to Youmuu’s-Collector seems pretty good, so you might want to give it a try.

&amp;#x200B;

The usual suspects, **Blitz, Rakan, Thresh, and Nautilus, are in Tier 1**. We aren’t going to give out a bunch of OP marks though. They’re showing good, but not great, performances. Maybe it's a different kind of balance. 

**Senna deserves the spotlight. She's stepped up once more with a 9.9% pick rate and 51.7% win rate**. She has good late-game value, and she's a champion who can adopt items like Umbral Glaive and Youmuu's So we think the potential is higher. As of today, she's already over a 10% pick rate So we think it's safe to say **she's practically Tier 1.**

**Maokai, who has higher late-game potential** than Senna, has also had a higher pick rate recently. **He has a 2% pick rate and a 53.5% win rate, so you should consider him. Morgana got patched** And Morgana Jungle has been getting a lot of attention, **so her pick rate as Support has also increased quite a bit**. There was a significant increase in her data, with a **pick rate of 4.7% and a win rate of 49.3%**. However, it's **not a perfect match for the current meta, so it has some limitations.**

new,Strange trend in ranked - thoughts/theories?,"Hi guys. My last dozen or so ranked games have been 2v8. My bot lane is just running it down without intentionally running it down (bless their hearts, they are trying). Same with my mid - albeit slightly less. I've had loss streaks before, but what the hell is happening with my mids and bots? I'm just seeing if anyone has experienced anything similar. If so, how did you solve?

# KDA from last 6 games (not duo with/camping top)

* My bot lane: 45/139/78
* My mid lane: 22/54/34
* Me (jungle): 29/26/62
* My top lane: 71/45/27

The KDAs don't do the situation justice because, once we get to mid-game, my top and I are able to somewhat make it competitive, so bot/mid's KDAs improve slightly. During the laning phase, it's absolutely absurd - like, 1-2/double-digits/1-2 sort of stuff. The feed is so demoralizing. Death after death after death. 2+ level disparities. 1-2 item disparities.

new,13.21 Full Patch Preview,"""Full Preview: 

**Jungle Followup**: Jungle followup isn't listed here, but we plan on returning the AD ratio to the pet and adjusting some of the healing values. Our short term plans are to get the within role balance back so the different classes (and the champions within them) are each viable again. 

**Bel'Veth**: We're trying to buff E a bit, especially now that it's worse at early ranks without further encouraging a few points Q -&gt; E max. 

**Hecarim**: Hec was disproportionately hit by the blue pet changes, we're adding some baseAD back to get him more onto Sheen builds rather than lethality

**K'Sante**: Lots of bugfixes for K'Sante, increasing damage in all out form and lowering cast time on Q with HP purchases

**Le'Blanc**: Buffs to W as her bread and butter spell and E as the spell that has more gameplay

**Aurelion Sol**: Taking some amount of damage out of tap Q's and moving more towards the burst Q's in addition to moving some damage out of level scaling and into rank scaling

**Briar**: We're a bit of power out of her statcheck (she should still be good at it), while retaining lane Briar being reasonably powerful

**Cait**: Discussed Cait yesterday, but we think Lethality Cait shouldn't be her most powerful build

**Jinx**: This change should allow Jinx's passive to still result in those ""unleashed moments"", while capping some of the high end cases that seem a bit much

**Rammus**: Taking his damage down a bunch through both W converting to resists and early Q damage. With the pet resist synergies, this should also reduce clear time by some amount

**Brand/Zyra**: Some small adjustments to get a few more mages and AP's into the jungle, not trying to displace their main roles

**Seraphine**: Through their pickrate, Seraphine players have expressed their desire to play her in the support position. This doesn't mean that we're making mid/bot seraphine dead, but trying to narrow the gap between them. 

**Hullbreaker**: We opted to pure nerf Hullbreaker, as it is degrading some side lane patterns a bit much; needing to buy Hullbreaker to match another Hullbreaker is not a particularly desirable pattern"" - https://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1714457786405548502

new,"How is Aurelion Sol meant to be ""fair""? What is his meaningful ""counterplay""?","Seriously, every time I see this thing on my games he completely runs away with the match once he gets Rylais and a couple passive stacks (Rylais being a completely different issue that I feel should be addressed at some point by giving it a cooldown or something...).

He's at a **52.27%** winrate on Emerald+ according to [U.GG](https://U.GG), and has been hovering around that winrate for literal months every time I've checked. How is that winrate ok for such a straightforward, sit back and farm up champion? Pick rate isn't anything super low, **3.8%** seems pretty standard in such a contested lane full of different picks.

Like maybe if his god status was delayed a little bit I'd understand, but unless he plays like a total ass and permashoves while being camped by the enemy jungler, this dick ALWAYS seems to hit his supernova by minute 15 of the game, at which point good luck winning ANY teamfight unless your team drafted Malph Amumu Vladimir Taric MF or some ""Bronzodia"" bs like that.

Yes I am salty and yes I am biased, but seriously, am I missing anything? How is this champion fair or balanced atm? What are any actual, MEANINGFUL weaknesses that can be exploited to set him back severely, or anything that isn't ""lol just cc him"" or ""lol just camp him 24/7""?

new,"Genuine Question, why is everyone not honor level 5?","look, I wont lie to myself, the honor level 5 rewords are hot booty cheeks. but all you have to do is play the game and not call people slurs. is it really that hard to just competitive bs and say ""damn, you're playing master yi, clearly you're ass at the game"" or something along those nature.  


I know league is probably one of the most toxic communities out there but, as someone who competitive bs's a lot, Honor level 5 is not that hard to get. Infact, I think its the easiest part about this game.   


I've been playing this game for about 3 years now and usually get honor level 5 within a few months of the reset because I don't understand peoples desire to tell everyone to ""keep themselves safe"" or call them racial or derogatory slurs. its a video game. 

what prompted me to ask this is because my friend recently just posted in my discord that he managed to reach honor level 0. and while I would be surprised, I know the man and I'm not surprised. but I've seen people here and twitter saying getting honor level 5 is too hard for what its worth. I promise you, its not. unless there's some secret about honor level I don't know about that's holding people back.

new,Why not display each players' gold in game?,"TL;DR: Gold should be displayed in game. Current champ power comparisons don't give good information, and players get wrongly flamed for bad KDA if they're impacting the game well by other means. Estimating power levels without a gold display isn't fun skill expression, and there would still be skill expression in comparing matchups and gold/items/levels. 

Why hide stats to make it harder to tell who's actually winning the game? Currently, we have to compare items, look at CS, and look at KDA to tell roughly how much gold a player has, and this still isn't the most accurate. Pro games already have gold display since it's important to know who's likely stronger in fights. This doesn't mean we should get rid of CS, KDA, or item displays, just show gold as well.

* CS isn't a very good indicator of anything. All it does is tell you roughly how well you've been playing your lane compared to your opponent, or how close you are to optimal 10cs/m. It gets especially worse when compared to jungle since camps don't track CS in a similar way. This sometimes results in players flaming junglers or junglers flaming everyone else for misunderstanding how CS works.
* Tower plate gold is completely impossible to track unless they've spent it on items. If two laners CS are the same, you might think they're doing the same in lane, but if one has gotten 4+ plates, they're actually way stronger. You can look at each turret pre-14 minutes to see plates taken, but after 14 minutes, good luck.
* Comparing items is the biggest chore of all. You have to look at each item, compare to components, compare to boots, and compare the prices of items. I'm not sure anyone can perfectly calculate gold from people's inventories, especially in-game when time is sensitive. Therefore, it's only a rough estimation of someone's power. Especially since full items vary widely in price, anywhere from 2100g to 3600g.
* KDA is the most stigmatized stat and probably the one most used to quickly check a player's current power. However, it's one of the worst indicators since assists vary a lot in the amount of gold they reward and shutdowns are all over the place. I've often seen toplaners be 2/5, so my team underestimates them, not realizing they've gotten plates, towers, and lots of shutdown gold, making them easily as strong as the 10/5 ADC. KDA is also the root of lots of flame from even experienced players misunderstanding the impact a player has on a game. 
* Say what you want about Thebausffs, but he's a good example of how KDA doesn't always translate to game impact. He's a multi-year challenger players who's gotten rank 1 before with a unique playstyle of trading his life for perfect CS, tower plates, towers, and tower damage. He'll often have lots of deaths and very negative KDA but still be the most fed player in the game.
* Shutdowns, objective bounties, and laners taking random jungle camps makes gold even harder to track. Why be forced to estimate it all the time, why not just give this type of information?

The only argument I can see in favor of keeping a gold display out of the game is ""skill expression,"" but to those who feel that way, I ask, *is estimating gold amounts a fun way to express your skill?* There are already a million fun skill expressive aspects of league like champion mastery, item builds, macro strategy, game knowledge, etc. If gold was displayed, you'd still have to estimate a players' actual champion strength relative to yours. Can a 5000g level 13 Jax beat a 6500g level 12 Master Yi? You'd still have to compare levels, items (especially defensive items), and champion matchups. In my opinion, hiding those gold values doesn't make this power comparison any more interesting. In fact, I believe displaying gold will open up the playerbase to more diverse strategies for getting ahead in game, saving them from getting wrongly flamed for having a bad KDA if they're impacting the game well by other means.",Masterfulidea,1697581173.0,0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17aaghc/why_not_display_each_players_gold_in_game/

new,"The issue with league is, that farming isn't rewarded anymore","Think about it, old league rewarded farming much more than new league did. For example, if you splitpushed at 15-16 minutes in the game, while everybody else was fighting for no objective aram midlane. You pushed a wave, into a camp that was killed in 3seconds, doing no dmg to you, into the next sidelane wave, into a enemy camp, into a recall.   
And today, the camp will kill you at 15minutes or half hp you down, while forcing you to waste 15seconds on it, or ur entire mana just before you can push out the next wave, and if a fight happened  near by, well now you feel bad because you lost all ur hp to fight.   


So now ur telling urself, skip the camp, just push the wave, well now you only got 2 waves worth of value and have to wait another 30seconds for the next minion wave, while ur entire team probably got aced 5v4 meanwhile. Great, good payoff.   
honestly this might be just the biggest reason why splitpushing is so much worse nowadays compared to the past, and feels so unrewarding today.  


In the past players got punished who burgerflipped midlane aramfights over and over with no clear outcome between the two teams, because you did this splitpush strat 3 times in a row, and now all of a sudden you had massive EXP/GOLD lead vs everybody else.

     * this formula is pretty complicated, crit chance and crit damage become additional tAD scalings, which gives the following results:
     * base tAD scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;60% / 90% / 120% @ 1 / 7 / 13 (unchanged)
     * additional tAD scaling from crit chance (**no iedge**):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;142.1875% --&gt; 148.75%
         * example:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;at level 13+ with 0% crit chance, then she doesn't gain anything extra and just has 120% tAD scaling, if she had 50% crit chance at level 13+ then she'd now have a 120% +(148.75% * 0.5) = 194.375% tAD scaling, and at 100% crit it'd now be 268.75% tAD scaling
     * additional tAD scaling from crit chance (**with iedge**):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;178.75% --&gt; 187.00%
         * her crit chance scaling also stacks multiplicatively with crit damage

 * P mark R true damage conversion:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35% constant --&gt; 45% / 60% / 75% @ 6 / 11 / 16
     * technically this means you will still gain benefit even if you don't upgrade your ult at those later ranks, but it might be easier to implement it this way to keep all the data for this effect on the passive instead of splitting some of it off onto the ult
 * Q cast time buffs from earlier are still in
 * W min charge duration:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0.65s --&gt; 0.75s (revert to live)
     * this was mistakenly claimed to be 0.65s on live when it was actually set to 0.75s, yesterday it was actually set to 0.65s, now it's back to 0.75s

It used to be I almost never bothered taking ignite top as I prefer cautious play and working with my team, but now leaving lane for any purpose - including actually just getting killed - results in your opponent getting even more of a gold lead, and most likely knocking your tower down to near half HP. 

It's even worse if someone as demolish. Just defend your tower from someone who just got a huge gold and XP lead on you. Demolish plus an attack speed boost or something else that can wreck a tower, like Nasus? Good luck.

The amount of time wasted on Rift because of trolls who ping, type, int, afk and after all don't want to surrender makes me wanna cry, litterally.

Here you have a few examples:

1. Illaoi top, ganked 2 times by enemy jungler, so she decided that ""we don't deserve a win"". When our jungler went top she just stood and watched angry how our Diana died alone. Didn't participate in any teamfight. **33 minutes wasted.**
2. Katarina, after 43 games had avg 14/5 but in my game did 0/4 and decided to troll for the rest of the game. **27 minutes wasted.**
3. Vayne, did 23/2 in my game, so ez win but suddenly decided to troll, running in the jungle for the rest of the game and let enemies to destroy entire base. **44 minutes wasted.**
4. Countless supports who decide to flame their adc for the rest of the game for doing 0/2 instead of trully supporting them. **150 games wasted**

These are only 4 examples but I experience it every day...  
These people are so mentally unstable and act like snowflakes that one ""KS"" or enemy gank can decide that all you can do is ff, but this is often not an option because they hold you hostage.

If you do stuff like these above, listen to me.

* Introduce movespeed nerf if outside of main ally radius to reduce roaming power;

* Grant them the same XP nerfs from minions (somewhat what junglers have) if not around the main ally

new,The new ranked restrictions are not the solution.,"I have been playing this game for years now and these new chat/ranked restrictions have been the worst thing riot has ever done, let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

Chat and ranked restrictions (yes they come in pairs) only target people who typed something that the system deems offensive, soft inting and inting in general is not target or resolved by this new system. All this system does is punish human interaction in game (eg: I got a chat and ranked restriction for typing ""the enemy comp is cancer"").  


And in my opinion, the punishment should be proportional to the crime, if someone is being a meanie in chat, forcing them to play game modes they dont like and taking away their ability to communicate will only make matters worse for  everyone. People who play video games or go outside will know that banter is a normal part of human interaction, calling something I did retarded or somebody else a dick  for smiting a cannon is totally normal.

new,Alois losing 2/3 games in emerald,"For those who don't know, Alois is a challenger top lane player, he peaked rank 8 in EUW split 1.

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of **the best** top laners in the world.... losing in emerald elo, not once, but 2/3 games he played. Does this mean Alois is a garbage player? Of course not, Alois is one of the best top lane players in EUW. So what does it mean then?

&amp;#x200B;

It means emerald is extremely unbalanced. Imagine you are a diamond 4 player in terms of skill, and you're placed into these games. A **challenger,** no, the **rank 8** player is still losing in these games. So **how** exactly is a **low diamond** player supposed to climb? Well looking at this, there's a very easy answer: he isn't. He can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong here. Alois is one of the best top laners in EUW. He **will** climb out of emerald, and with ease. It is possible if you are 1k lp above emerald, sure. But for low diamond players just wanting to reach the rank they belong in? No chance. None. If **THE BEST TOP LANE PLAYERS IN THE WORLD** are losing in this elo, there is **NO CHANCE** a diamond player will be able to consistently carry the games necessary to be able to climb out.

new,It's incredibly easy to make mogana jg viable and balanced but the dev just keep missing their mark.,"First off, Morgana Jungle makes way sense than support.  
Not only does her passive and W actually work together but have value and are useable.  
You can use black shield to make sure the enemy can't use cc as a means of escape.  
Landing your Q has even more value.  
The increase gold income helps you ALOT to make your ult viable by buying the 3k gold item that allows you to use your ult in a teamfight.  
  
But they keep missing the damn mark man. Like wtf are they doing.  
  
***How to make Morgana Jungle Epic***:    
  
1- Her ult needs to give a shield based on how many people she ulted. Something like  69/169/269 per person she ulted. Remove the Movespeed since Morgana WILL buy rylai's anyway + Morg jungle has smite.
2- Increase the duration of Q versus jungle mobs by 69%.  
3- Increase her base model size by 6.9% to allow for better intimidation tactis.  
4- Nerf diana's model by reducing her thigh size.  
5- Increase the duration of Q versus jungle mobs by 0.69%.  
6- Increase her base AD to 69.  
7- For an ""Anti mage"" mage, her magic resist caps at 52ish by lvl 18. Change her per level to 2.3 instead. This will give her 69 MR by rank 18.  
8- The Damage of W against jungle mobs needs to be 169.69%.
9- Give her a voice line versus kayle ""I will chain you up with 69 chains and feed you to nafari you disgrace.""

new,It's statistically probable that a top 8 team doesn't make it past Swiss stage,"I'm not trying to make any commentary, just provide some stats.

If you assume every team will beat all the teams ranked worse than them, and lose to every team ranked better, there is still a 50% chance of one of the top 8 teams not making it through. If you introduce some random chance to the matches so they aren't 100% determined by strength ranking, the chance of one of the top 8 teams not making it goes up, so the true chance of an upset is &gt;50%.

So there's a pretty good chance of one of g2, fnc, c9, or whatever team you think is just below top 8, making it through, even if they can't beat the best teams. Some hopium for the western fans going into the Swiss stage.

new,The removal of Barron pit possibly in preseason 2024,"https://ibb.co/tDYKZ1R

Saw some interesting leaks on the removal of Barron pit. Wasn’t sure if anyone posted about it. Looks like riot is thinking about removing the Barron pit in preseason 2024, curious how it’ll affect the game state. As you can see it looks like the tribush will be removed in the top lane and replaced by a large wall.

A lot of KC official fan accounts as well as team members or any KC-affiliated media like YamatoCannon have been tweeting cryptic, yet hyped and positive KC-related content for almost an hour. This includes LEC Wooloo, big teaser and esport insider.

Picture itself tweeted by Kameto is explicit enough to show something very big happened. He also said during KCX3 that the 14th October would bring him and the team the answers regarding their admissions within the LEC.

Of course we are waiting for a bilateral announcement by both the official LEC team and LOL esport officials.

new,Hot Take: NA would be better if they were never allowed imports.,"I truly believe if na couldn’t import players at all they’d be a much stronger region. Over the years there’s been many players that get straight up ignored in favour of a weaker player from other regions. By not having imports it would force NA to value development and it would motivate more players to try to go pro because it’s possible. There would likely be less turnover and more commitment to players long term development rather than replacing them the moment they had a bad set of games. 

What do you guys think?",gid_hola,1697562500.0,0,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17a38ol/hot_take_na_would_be_better_if_they_were_never/

new,Terrible idea tuesday: Make Nilah's healing passive work on opponents' healing instead,"Was watching c9sneaky play nilah last night with a cassiopia support and I was stoned out of my mind. Then it hit me: wouldn't it be interesting if nilah's healing passive worked on opponents' healing instead? So you could pick her as a counter to teams with lots of innate healing. Make it so its net-enemy healing (so after healing reduction) so it isn't crazy OP.

Kinda opens nilah up as an option to counter certain supports/tanks/briar that have a ton of healing. You'd just fight back and it would be a stalemate 1v1. Might even open nilah up to being played in other roles since she won't be as reliant on teammates to heal her/keep her alive.",Mooseandchicken,1697561788.0,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17a2yea/terrible_idea_tuesday_make_nilahs_healing_passive/

new,so i returned to the game after taking a break for half a year,"My conclusion? The comunity of this game is by far the worst i have ever seen.  
And im not talking about toxic people.  
\- everyone being passively agresive towards eachother all the time no mater what.  
\- surrendering games with a 2k gold defecit and even objectives. a lot.  
\- Im talking about giving up on the game because people are going even in lane and just runing it down.  
before you say, oh this is only in x low elo.  
I played on both my accounts one is a d4 acc. the other is a lvl 36 acc i used at some point long time ago, tought id have a look at how a freshish acc looked like.  
By far the low lvl acc was the least bad altho skill dif is quite obvious most of the time.  
Both ranked and unraked i saw these cases the random ff slightly les in ranked since there are 2/5 that are still trying to play the game a lot of the time.  
I will not be returning dispite my friends  constantly naging me to play league with them.

new,Auction Madness is the best interactive game to play along with Worlds,"**Intro**  
Hey guys - My company has been working on a fantasy app which is a little unique to traditional fantasy sports.  It is 100% free to play (there is no option to even take your money) and is currently being tested and used for fun.  I just today set it up to work with Worlds and created a few public rooms that I hope people are interested in participating in.  If the public rooms fill up - I will create more or you can create your own private rooms and invite your friends!  


**How to Play**  
Simply navigate to [AuctionMadness.com](https://AuctionMadness.com) and sign up with your gmail or email account.  Once in, you will see that you can choose to create a group for you and your friends or join a public room and play with others.  For Worlds, group sizes are limited to 4 people.  In Auction Madness there's a set time that you have a LIVE auction for all 16 teams remaining in the tournament.  All 4 managers are given $100 in play money to bid on the 16 teams.  **Important:** Each manager will end with **exactly 4 teams** meaning if you are the highest bidder on the first 4 teams, you cannot bid any more for the rest of the auction so manage your budget accordingly!  


**The Auction**  
The auction is a **live event** and has a designated start time.  The auction will start even if you are not there, so make sure you're there on time to be able to participate!  Auctions for this event should take about 15 minutes.  In it, a team is selected at random to be bid on and when the time expires or everyone else has passed, the team is awarded to the leading bidder.  If all managers pass or no bids are placed, the team is put in the back of the line and a new team is selected.  


**Scoring**  
In Auction Madness points are denoted with a dollar sign ($) even though **there is no money at risk or in play - it is a free website.**  If you choose to set up a separate private room you can adjust scoring, but for our public rooms the scoring works as follows:  
\* All Swiss games are worth 6 points each (BO3s are treated as one game)  
\* All 8 teams that make it to the KO stage earn an additional 7 points  
\* The 4 teams that win the Quarterfinals earn  an additional 15 points  
\* The 2 teams that win the Semifinals earn an additional 24 points  
\* The Worlds winner will earn an additional 38 points  


For example a team that goes 2-3 in Swiss and is eliminated will earn 12 points.  


A team that goes 3-1 in Swiss and is eliminated in the Semifinals Earns 40 points broken down as:  
\* 6 points per swiss win = 18 points  
\* 7 points for making it to the KO stage for a total of 25 points  
\* 15 points for winning in the Quarterfinals for grand total of 40 points  


I'm very excited to share this with you all and really hope you enjoy it!  I've joined one of our public rooms, if you'd like to join my group, follow this invite link:

new,Anyone predicting 7 eastern teams + G2 for worlds SWISS doesn't understand the format,"Potentially unpopular opinion. As people start doing their pick'ems for SWISS, just remember to not default to thinking like it is double elim. As an example, it is possible for MAD to make it to quarters by beating 3 NA teams and upsetting BLG in a bo3. Similarly, its possible for NA to completely dodge major eastern regions (although the faith in NA is already low), beat each other, and then beat MAD in a bo3. On the flip side, g2 or fnc could be tasked with playing only eastern region teams. Who knows what will happen

new,"For fun and memory's sake, here's a trivia quiz on the funniest bugs out of old Mordekaiser's 350+ bug count","Hey everyone! 

Mordekaiser's rework has now been here for about 4.5 years (crazy, huh), and I wanted to make a fun little thing for everyone to smile and laugh a bit about the wonders this champion brought us before his rework. 

For the people who wouldn't know because it's been a long while now, pre-rework Mordekaiser was, by a very long shot, the buggiest character in League's history, with [over 350 bugs found](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8fcwr7/and_to_conclude_the_streak_with_over_300_book/), [enough to make a book out of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaHJlgsDYa4). 

Some of them were irrelevant, and lots of them were impactful but boring. But some of his bugs were downright hilarious, and so I want to make people recall or discover these beautiful creations. 

So here's a trivia quiz on some of Mordekaiser's best bugs! 

&amp;nbsp;

**1) What gameplay difference did Mordekaiser’s skins use to make in 2016?**

- A) They gave his ghosts a chance to turn invisible. 

- B) They gave dragon pets a leash range. 

- C) They made his VFX visible through fog of war. 

- D) They doubled his shield generation. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!B) They gave dragon pets a leash range.  
Unlike the other big summons, Mordekaiser's dragon didn't have a leash range and wasn't intended to have one. Mordekaiser could be bot lane while his dragon was mid. Except that for the first year of juggernaut Mordekaiser's existence - all the way up until we found the explanation - his dragon had no leash range with the basic skin, and had one if he wore any other skin (the dragon would blink back to him if he'd go further than ~2000 units away from him). [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2zsY072Gz4)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**2) What happened when Mordekaiser killed Ekko after ulting him?** 

- A) Ekko's ghost ulted the blue team's fountain before warping back to where he died. 

- B) Ekko's ghost had permanently increased range and each of his attacks made him dash to his target. 

- C) Ekko's ghost spawned on the blue team's fountain and instantly died if Mordekaiser was on the red team. 

- D) Ekko's ultimate was replaced with Mordekaiser's for the remainder of the game. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!A) Ekko's ghost ulted the blue team's fountain before warping back to where he died.  
Dealing full damage and all (counted as Mordekaiser's). [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ucNmbm65w4)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**3) What happened when Sylas attempted to use Mordekaiser’s ultimate on a target entering a bush?**

- A) The target immediately died and respawned without a death timer. 

- B) Mordekaiser gained control of the resulting ghost instead of Sylas. 

- C) Sylas transformed into Mordekaiser until his death. 

- D) Sylas lost the ability to use his keystone until the end of the game. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!C) Sylas transformed into Mordekaiser until his death.  
When ulting, Sylas takes the shape of the champion he uses the ult of during the cast. But with Mordekaiser’s ult, if the spell got canceled (by losing vision on the target), he would just… not transform back, until his death. [Thread with a video and everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/MordekaiserMains/comments/ambxji/explaining_the_sylas_transforming_into/)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**4) Runes affecting shields have a history of not working correctly for Mordekaiser. By how much did Revitalize increase his shield generation, at most?**

- A) 0%

- B) 16.5%

- C) 110%

- D) 1005%

**Correct answer:** &gt;!D) 1005%  
For years, Revitalize didn’t work properly on Mordekaiser’s shield generation (gain 5% HSP, heals and shields you cast or receive are 10% stronger on targets below 40% HP). Then someday, it got “fixed”. Except that instead of increasing his shield by 5% and 10%, it went on to increase it by 5% + 1000%. Here’s what his [passive](https://prnt.sc/lkmaz0) and [E](https://prnt.sc/lkmgno) looked like with it.!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**5) What happened when Pulsefire Ezreal killed an enemy affected by Mordekaiser’s ultimate?**

- A) No ghost was created. 

- B) A ghost was created, but its basic attacks were permanently replaced with targeted Mystic Shots. 

- C) A ghost was created, but it was permanently invisible and impossible to click on. 

- D) A ghost was created, but it was permanently invisible and stuck in place. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!C) A ghost was created, but it was permanently invisible and impossible to click on.  
In most cases, Mordekaiser’s ghosts took the shape and most properties that the champion had upon dying. A champion turning into a ghost while in an invisible state would, in several cases, make the ghost fully invisible. And Pulsefire Ezreal disintegrates the enemies he kills. [Video](https://youtu.be/zfM4oT4cftg?t=590)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**6) What could Mordekaiser NOT do for his opponents?** 

- A) Give an enemy a heal of 1500+ hitpoints with his W. 

- B) Give the opposing team the Baron buff. 

- C) Give the enemies his location through fog of war. 

- D) Give the other team bonus AP with his ultimate. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!D) Give the other team bonus AP with his ultimate.  
A) An enemy Braum could eat Mordekaiser’s heal and take it for himself (and that heal could go in the 1500-range). [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCpoY2c3Hsw)  
B) No video of that one, but if you’d attack Baron with the ghost of a Darius, have the ghost die, and then have Baron die from the bleed, it’d be given to Darius’ team and not to yours.  
C) Mordekaiser’s W detonation could be heard through fog of war. If you’d put your camera over where an enemy Mordekaiser was and he’d use his W, you’d be able to hear it even without vision. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbK6FGUzyE).!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**7) A Jhin ghost could have some advantages compared to the real Jhin. Which one of these options could a Jhin ghost NOT have?**

- A) Every attack firing the 4th shot. 

- B) 2.5 attack speed. 

- C) Attack range permanently increased to 700. 

- D) Critical hits dealing 200/225% damage at all levels. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!D) Critical hits dealing 200/225% damage at all levels.  
A) Probably Mordekaiser’s most famous interaction – Jhin’s ghost would never use ammunition, and as such would remain on whatever bullet he died with. So killing a Jhin with his fourth shot ready would result in the ghost firing his fourth shot on every basic attack. [Video](https://youtu.be/x4oi_OroBPI?t=25)  
B) Jhin’s ghost also had unlocked attack speed. So he could reach upwards of 2.5 AS. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR4yZO0npI0)  
C) Ghosts could gain Energized charges, but they couldn’t trigger Statikk/RFC’s empowered attacks. That meant that they would never *lose* the charges, and that RFC’s increased range would apply to every attack once charged.  
D) That one is *almost* applicable too. Jhin’s crits deal reduced damage compared to other champions’, but for some reason, a Jhin ghost would only get that damage reduction after level 16 – crits before that dealt full damage. D ends up being the correct answer because of “at all levels”.  
[And here’s a display of a fearsome Jhin ghost.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9f4lG9S6wA)!&lt;  

&amp;nbsp;

**8) What could happen when you activated the Guardian Angel of an opponent affected by Mordekaiser’s ultimate?**

- A) Your ultimate was replaced with Mordekaiser’s for the remainder of the game. 

- B) Your abilities stopped functioning until the ghost died. 

- C) Every player crashed and the game disappeared. 

- D) The opponent’s Guardian Angel was automatically sold the moment it was activated. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!A) Your ultimate was replaced with Mordekaiser’s for the remainder of the game.  
There's an explanation, but just take the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tATL2XjVMbQ).!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**9) What could using Protobelt cause for Mordekaiser?**

- A) Make Mordekaiser’s ghosts release the Protobelt projectiles on every basic attack for the rest of the game. 

- B) Make Mordekaiser’s W invisible for the rest of the game. 

- C) Prevent Mordekaiser’s E from dealing damage. 

- D) Disable the opponents’ Press the Attack keystone. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!B) Make Mordekaiser’s W invisible for the rest of the game.  
Using Protobelt with W active would make the effects of the spell disappear from that point on, for all players who had their screen on Mordekaiser the moment he used the item (on either team). [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfHWIrWQvXk)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**10) What happened when Mordekaiser used his ultimate to kill an enemy Mordekaiser’s ghost?**

- A) The champion killed gained the ability to create a dragon ghost. 

- B) The ghost refreshed and came back with full health and a full timer under the control of the enemy Mordekaiser, but lost its items. 

- C) Mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed, and until his next death, his shield would fully refill whenever it got depleted. 

- D) Mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed, but with a permanent +100% attack speed and bonus movement speed. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!D) Mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed, but with a permanent +100% attack speed and bonus movement speed.  
This was a bug that I found really late despite playing a lot of blind pick. I guess you just… never think of wasting your ult on a ghost. I have no idea how that happened, but the ghost of a ghost had some properties of a dragon ghost – Mordekaiser’s ult icon was replaced with the one he got from controlling the dragon, the ghost gained bonus movespeed towards Morde (like the dragon’s), it had bonus attack speed, and it didn’t gain the bonus AD and HP that a champion ghost would get from Mordekaiser’s stats. This couldn’t be chained – that ghost would not give a ghost from being ulted by Mordekaiser. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR4yZO0npI0)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

And that’s a wrap! 

What score did y’all get? I’ve made this quiz a year or two ago but only privately shared it, and I’m very curious to see what everyone would guess. 

Oh, here’s a note - while each question only had one correct answer, nearly all of the wrong options were strongly inspired by other real bugs!

new,Champion design failure,"New flashy champs have smaller animations than old champs ofc. while new champs are overloaded, so they do small tick damages but with big effects. I feel old champs are so damn nukey these days, using skills at me and melting my entire HP in a few hits. Ads used to be like Aps.  
I know it seems off-topic, but I think they should make hard champions by design, and not just add more buttons and call it hard. I mean, they have already tried to make hard champions, but they have failed (like Aphelios and Ksante). While challenging, the challenge was intended to be the hardest they claimed to be, it wasn't something like a final ultimate attack from certainlyT. Overloaded champions like Yasuo (who isn't really overloaded now) have an insanely unique playstyle that makes them difficult while having a lot of buttons, and new ones don't even have that. Compared to 2013-2016, I felt that 2013+2016 designs were best at making things difficult without buttons",Easy_Kaleidoscope673,1697552645.0,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179zjzo/champion_design_failure/
new,A Future Game Mode Idea (20th Anniversary?),"The first paragraph is for the context of why I am posting this idea, if you want to skip and go straight to the idea, it will be the next paragraph.

I was watching some OLD videos from what I consider the glory era of league of legends, I see old urgot, old mordekaiser, old aatrox, old quinn, old graves, old galio, old yorick, old poppy, old pantheon, etc etc. It made me wish in a way that the current players that weren't around for most of these, if not all of these, were able to experience playing all of the old iterations of these champions. I started in season 3, with lissandra's release. I've experienced most of the ones I've listed, but there were even some versions of champions that I wasn't around for. I've seen videos of ap master yi, beta twisted fate, and stuff like that. It makes me wish there was a way to experience them again, or experience something of the past for the first time. Which is where the following paragraph comes into play.

I have a game mode idea, most likely would be for an anniversary event in the future. Maybe the 20th anniversary, just throwing that out there. A game mode where not only you could select all the current champions in league of legends, but all of the old versions of the champions as well. I know some  have been minireworked 3000 times (Zeri I'm looking at you), but maybe to keep it simple, the on release versions of any champion that was considered a full rework. I won't count beta for this since that is considered a testing stage. So Season 1 and onward, any champion that had a previous version.  Imagine going top lane, It's Urgot of today, versus the Urgot of the past. Even if the event only lasted a month, I think it would be cool to let players experience these old versions of champions. To make the game mode even crazier, they bring back all the old rift/twisted treeline/crystal scar items that were removed. Maybe that's too far, but this idea is already too far in my own eyes, but I wanted to share it anyways.

What does Reddit think? I'd like to hear your opinions! This idea is already so outlandish, might as well have fun thinking about it, personally I'd love to play on release Graves/Pantheon/Sylas again (for nitpickers I know I said season 3 was my start), but I know I'll never be able to, I'd like to believe I could play all of them again.

I had this impression since the skin was released, and now that it's is back at the shop, I remembered it. It really feels that DRX Aatrox took some inspirations from Omega's design; which I think is great because Megaman Zero doesn't get much recognizition despite being an amazing series.

Aside from stories' contexts and other nuances, both are giant dudes with big swords scarred by war who scream all the time and only seek the destruction of everything.

The resemblance is lost with the prestige version, and I'm aware this may be a huge coincidence; and if it is, it's still great. A champ that I like to play has a skin that strongly resembles an antagonist of a game series I love, and that's all I need.

new,Tired of garbage rage bating videos on Youtube,"Recently watched this video of a professional player raging about how Yone loses to Fiora level 1 and how the ""Game isn't balanced"" because it wasn't ""Close"". This line of thinking and blatant whinging really bugs me and I want to explain why. Video below:   
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BygBy2DiW1w&amp;lc=Ugy6cDblA1\_Ku-BF9114AaABAg.9vqHWw97Ee79vySlZ8gAMC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BygBy2DiW1w&amp;lc=Ugy6cDblA1_Ku-BF9114AaABAg.9vqHWw97Ee79vySlZ8gAMC)  


Now I'm not an Esports pro, but I play a lot of League. I think it's rather common knowledge that Fiora has one of the strongest level 1's in the game next to tryndamere and darius. In this video you will see Fiora engage into the Yone's caster minions to proc a vital. The yone immediately responds with his Q and follows up with autos to begin stacking lethal tempo. They both begin to kite out, the Fiora kites away from his minions and Yone begins to kite into the Fiora's minions. Yone's lethal tempo gets fully stacked and utilizes auto resets with Q to dish out a lot of damage, while Fiora does the same while also procing vitals. The 1v1 ends when Fiora predicts the Yone's flash at the beginning of her auto attack animation, securing the vital proc at the end of her auto attack animation.   


The argument from the pro is that the 1v1 was not even close and the game is clearly not balanced at all because the Fiora was tanking the Yone's caster minions. Clearly tanking caster minions in a 1v1 at level 1 means you should auto lose according to his logic. While it is true Fiora took more aggro than Yone here, the Yone still took plenty of aggro himself and also doesn't have bone plating like Fiora does which is has a huge impact early game on all ins.   


Personally, I find it really disingenuous for a few reasons here and I'll explain why its rage bait. 

1. Professional players should know that champions have power spikes at different levels. A champion may be weaker earlier than they are mid to late game and vice versa. I note this because again, Fiora has an extremely strong level 1 because of her passive, and Yone has what? Lethal tempo and Q? Professionals should not advertise that all champions should be of equal strength at all levels of the game. Even if that means 1 champion can tank 6 more hits from minions at level 1. 
2. No one wants a game where all champions are of equal strength at all stages and period of the game. People obviously want to be able to have an advantage over others at certain time to push advantages. Because of this, there will ALWAYS be a champion that is stronger than another champion at level 1, even if that means tanking 6 more hits from a caster minion. 
3. Even if the Yone did more damage level 1 or Fiora has less base health level 1. Should the Yone be expected to win despite not guarding his vitals? The Yone decided to all in, instead of backing out, he did not guard his vitals using terrain, nor did he win the flash prediction. The Fiora played it well enough to proc the vitals. Why should Fiora lose anyway when she executed the function and identity of her champion while Yone doesn't even have any crit yet? Of course later on in the game it might be impossible to use terrain to block vitals, which is why later on in the game it is more about the number of vitals proc'd. 

This kind of complaining without acknowledging the differences in champion and game mechanics is completely dishonest and does not help people playing the game actually understand how and why a champions should win fights. I would expect high elo players to already know that Fiora wins level 1, and instead of kiting into her minions and committing to an all in where you didn't even get the First hit in, kiting back to the safety of the tower, or at least staying near your minions to keep that advantage. It was really only when the Yone committed to the fight and started taking minion aggro himself that he lost the fight. In this kind of high elo match up, Yone shook hands with Fiora and agreed to the fight.

new,Scared to Queue Ranked.,"Hello, I am not sure if I am the only one here.

I used to play Dota 2 from 2010 until 2020, and I ranked in the Top 100 in North America from 2017 to 2019. However, my motivation dropped, and it began to feel like a chore to play. I stopped playing and started looking for a new game.

I tried playing League of Legends around 2021, and I fell in love with the game. It was so refreshing for my eyes and offered so much to learn, but my interest only lasted for a year. Now, after a long break, I downloaded League of Legends again two weeks ago, and I'm suddenly feeling a competitive drive to play the game.

However, for some reason, I'm afraid to play ranked games. It's as if something is preventing me from queuing for ranked matches, and I end up in ARAM queues instead. Maybe my drive to play and reach the top is not that strong?

I've been playing since season 7 and it's always been toxic, let's not pretend otherwise, but we used to have banter, funny exchanges and overall respectful interactions. Trolls will be trolls, but the average player would generally act like a real person even when losing. Nowadays i only see the worst of the worst in players (the ones who still communicate at all, anyway). If i start off with a ""good morning"" or ""glhf"" i get answered with slurs and mean wishes, and if i get outplayed and compliment my opponent i receive a ""stfu you're so trash"" to the face. There's just no respect for ourselves and each other anymore.

All in all i just want to know people's thoughts on why that is. Have we just pushed away anyone ""normal"" and this is what's left? Is the game's design that makes us behave like this? Have we all just slowly get turned into goblins? Interested to see what people think

new,How do you play as ADC when your front liners don't engage?,"So I've hit diamond (euw) on all roles except ADC. I'm pretty much one tricking Twitch as he's the only one that I enjoy playing.

One problem I'm encountering very often and I don't know how to overcome is actually being able to use my lead to win us games because my team refuse to tank damage and let me pop off.

So let's say i'm 7-0. Destroyed my lane, but let's say another couple of lanes on my team have hard lost (standard scenario). I know I'm in a position to carry the game. I'm turning up and pinging objectives knowing crucial team fights are likely to break out. My \[Insert Front Line Top Laner or Jungler here\] are watching the enemy team take Drake/Baron. They're moving back and fourth with no purpose. I'm pinging assistance inside the drake pit to tell them to go in. It literally doesn't matter if they die, I know with my superior positioning, mechanics and gold advantage I can win us the team fight and objective. All the while I'm waiting safely around the corner waiting to Twitch Q my way into the fight once it's begun and crucial CC abilities from the enemy are used.

BUT NO........ My front liner doesn't want to go in. Instead watches them take the objective (front row cinema ticket) before the enemy team collapse onto my front liner and just explode him before I can even help. By this point, nobody else is even around bc they've run away after seeing the objective has been taken. It's either a 5v2 with my front liner which I really don't wanna do no matter how fed I am (and the bounty I have) or we just never get to fight.

new,About riot's username changes,"Basically, riot is swapping from unique summoner names specific to league of legends to usernames, with a TAG, across all of their games. Meaning that while in league of legends, you used to have a username different from valorant, a unique one too, lets say MafiaQiQi, now your username will look like MafiaQiQi#EUW1 across every riot games' title.

Following this main change, riot has announced the following adjustments:

* Name changes cannot be purchased with blue essence anymore. They will be purchased using the relevant of $10 in-game currency. With a free name change every year.
* Names will be global across all riot games.

I personally believe this change is actually terrible and shouldn't happen due to the following reasons

* You no longer have the feeling of unique identity belonging to you, if you thought of a unique funny username that you feel proud of, everyone else may use it, even in the same server.
* Your gaming identity is supposed to be a picture of how you would describe yourself in a fiction world. By forcing users to select a TAG, you are limiting the way they can express themselves.
* The fact that changing it in less than a year costs $10, following the samira overpriced skin, the dark cosmic erasure jhin skin, and some may say the redeemed star guardian xayah &amp; rakan shows that riot has been getting greedy, minimal work for tons of profit, and while yes this is how companies are supposed to work, riot for as long as I remember hasnt been this way, I felt like they showed a feeling of caring about players, making affordable skins for as low as 400rp, now, while we still have access to epic skins, it is shown that the newest of their choices, specifically those that I said above, show a feeling of greedyness, at least the way I see it.
* Adding to the above, I feel like it should be mentioned that this year, riot invested the biggest budget compared to other years on league of legends.
* Blue essence will be completely useless for people that have unlocked every champion, except for essence emporiums(by the time a new champion comes out, those players would have plenty of BE to buy the champion like 9 times).

Some argue, that this is indeed a good change because

* 2 or more people would be able to use the same username

This is true but this doesnt promote unique identities in the game world. Instead you are gonna see the same usernames on 30% of the games. Furthermore, if someone mains zeri in league and puts a username like IamLightning, or he just puts a funny username like AlwaysDyingCarry he is gonna be forced to have the same username on valorant and other riot titles, where the community there is likely to not get the joke. Furthermore, seeing funny unique usernames, gives me a smile most of the time, however, seeing, AlwaysDyingCarry username every 9 games makes the joke no longer funny.

Judging by the comments on their twitter post, the majority of the community by far HATES this change and I can see myself why. However I wondered what reddit would think of this, id appreciate if you could all state your opinion and reasoning below, and I would be happy to read through most of the comments. Thank you if you decide to engage in the discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments, I have read most of them. I was originally planning to respond to every single one. However I really cant do so, there are over 900 comments soon to be 1k I never expected it to be this much. Your views have given me insights both on how yall see your own username and on how yall perceive the game's direction in the future.

Some points id like to address include the following, I will probably keep editing the post with more updates based on what I read.

Many people are saying that this is not a ""serious"" change and the game is free2play etc. Yep, I agree with that, I will still keep playing the game after these name changes, this post isnt a rant of some sort, I simply felt like sharing my opinion and asking on how others perceive this change.

""If you care about your identity in a game, you would not be changing it every X months"" - While this may be true, there are still people who just like changing their ign, including me? I have used many joke usernames including AlwaysDyingCarry, H\*ntaiSenpai, MafiaQiQi, ParentsLost5050, Ceo of RACISM, CEO of Oxygen and many others that I feel like will at least make a few % of players laugh. Changing it, gives me that feeling of being different and also I make my friends laugh with them when we queue up. It also gives me a reason to grind for blue essence while also giving a chance to another player to use them too.

""Uniqueness doesnt matter its just a game LUL, games and identity? no lul"" -  [According to some research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/brain-trust/201512/online-games-show-player-personality-and-how-change-it), your username and how you choose to play in an online world can hint at your personality and by compiling millions and millions of these data points, the researchers point out that they can guess at ""psychological traits across global populations."" This is just the first result that came up from a google search, if someone dedicades more time, I am pretty sure he can find up more about this. There are of course other factors in someone choosing a username. However, it is still YOUR identity it is HOW you see yourself and want to be seen by fellow players. It is something you chose other people to see you for.

""I dont care lol imagine caring about usernames"" - This is a post made so that I, the OP can get a better understanding of what the community thinks about this change, if you have nothing to contribute to the discussion, then simply stay quiet lol, sometimes silence is just the better option. I never once mentioned that this is a GAME CHANGING change, or that this will destroy league, or anything along those lines, I as mentioned above, will still keep playing the game even if this change goes through.",PROManosWAR,1697536589.0,2662,1195,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179uqky/about_riots_username_changes/

new,my thoughts on the jungle changes,"hey :),

I play pretty much league and would call myself a jungle main. 

First off I do agree, jungle was broken for the last few months maybe years, but the new changes took away all the fun. It takes ages to clear your jungle and you as a jungle are now permanently busy with farming your camps. I guess that this is fine as you have less oportunity to gank, but at the same time, if you power farm, you will be behind in gold to all laners. 

I talked to a few friends and they got a similiar feeling.

I thought, that maybe it would be a great change to drastically lower the gold and xp a camp can give. At the same time decrease a camps hp and resistances and respawn timer. 

That way the satisfactory level is way higher as you are still busy farming, but dont feel like playing the game in slow motion. At the same time jungle tracking becomes a more important skill, as a jungle can rotate way more. And more importantly: currently you have to perma farm, as catchup xp is lowered and you can fall behind 1-2 lvls in jungle just by ganking. But because clearing takes so long, you have just small time frames with long pauses, where you are able to access a specific lane. With my proposed changes, you would have more, but smaller timeframes you could use for a gank, but because of the higher clear speed, a good jungler can take your whole jungle on the other map side in the same timeframe. 

Maybe I am too low elo, but I think those changes would massivly improve satisfaction levels in jungle, because currently clearing camps takes all the fun away. (Atleast for me)

new,Should Tryndamere's ult make him immune to tower shots?,"I can understand being unkillable by champions, that's fine, but I don't see why he gets to be immune to towers for 5 seconds on demand at level 6. This makes the situation of you take 1 negative trade against him in lane, now he perma sustains up with his Q and then just afk walks at you under tower and you die. No skill, no skillshots, no spacing, just walks at you.

At least with other top champs like Kled for example, the immunity is conditional and it still requires skill to kill under tower. Alongside that, other champs with immunity to towers in dives have been removed to just be immune to champions. Champs like Pantheon and Viego are some examples of this, now they only block the damage of champs because their dives were too toxic with it.

I can understand making the argument of if you take an extended fight with him in the lane, then fine it's not a good idea. But the dives at level 6 are just so brutal and overbearing with no real counter to it with a good amount of top champs except just refusing to play or going to another lane. Maybe they could make it so at level 11 it becomes immune to towers or something, but having it at level 6 just feels too strong into a decent amount of matchups.

Edit: Add this into the fact that he can cast it while suppressed and shit for whatever reason, probably because ""haha old champ"" but into champs like Urgot he can outplay him, hit the ult, get him under the hp, and get the execute and then at last second while getting pulled while suppressed, Trynd ults and Urgot still loses the fight under his own tower.

new,Old Banner of Command was more healthy than is current iteration in Hullbreaker,"Let's be honest, the Old banner of command was toxic, I too remember that meta where you got baron and put an Ivern bush on the minion while it four shot towers. That said I think from an enjoyment standpoint that was a better place for the usage of a split-pushing item that also had usage  when playing with the team. We know that that iteration of the split push item has since went the way of the dodo due to balancing issues which was of course reasonable. What is interesting to note here is that I feel hullbreaker serves the role of a splitpusher item even worse. At the end of the end hullbreaker is the single largest stat stick riot has ever made to the point where it becoming a staple item on champions that want to teamfight eg, Yas, Yone, and even 4th on Samira. This not only is the least interactive way to make a champion strong is the sidelane, its not even at the expense of teamfighting power since the core stats are so insane anyways. At the end of the day hullbreaker as has managed to do a poorer job at being a splitpusher's item then its previous iterations and I think that that's a damn shame. I think at this point the item archetype is here to stay, so what do you think could be done to make a splitpushing item that feels less oppressive and more skill expressive.

new,Why not add ranked decay for every rank instead of splitting the season into 3 ?,"The whole point of splits was because people reached their desired ranks in the start of the year and then camped them for the rest of the season. So why not add ranked decay ? The current diamond decay system would work perfectly in the ranks below (higher elo is more strict). Basically you can have up to 28 banked days, so 28 days that you can not play and perserve your rank. Every single game you play adds 7 days to that counter. So you have to basically play 1 game per week or 4 games per month. The decay would be 50lp per day if your banked days are over and you drop a maximum of 400lp. (numbers could vary and change, obviously)

That is pretty easy on the player even if they have a busy life. Morever, in the end of each month, reward players with something for being X rank. So that there is motive to play throughout the whole year.

3 ranked splits feels more like a chore to regain your old rank every time instead of a fun experience. You are not going to be playing to climb higher or maintain your rank, you will be playing to just get back to it. Not very exciting if you ask me.

new,HullBreaker is just Banner of Command but Better,"For people who don't know Banner of Command was an item you bought to promote a minion to take % reduced damage from enemy champions and turrets and granted it bonus stats on a 2 minute cooldown it also gave all the gold killed by the minion to its owner.

It gave 125% base health regen, 60 armor, and 30 MR and cost 2200 gold - Riot removed Banner of Command because well, the item influenced a terrible meta where people bought it just for pushing and would make a team to protect the cannon minion from getting killed either by poking away the enemy team or making sure they couldn't walk up to do anything at all about the minion.

&amp;#x200B;

Introducing HullBreaker! This item gives (while no allied champs are nearby) 20-60 armor and magic resistance depending on level which is amazing stats and YOU deal 20% more damage to towers! Not even adding to the fact that you indirectly buff your large minion (IT CAN BE A SUPER MINION) 60-180 armor/magic resistance and it deals 200% increased damage to towers!

Not even accounting for the rest of the stats it gives the champion which include - 300 HP, 150% base health regen, 60 AD and a 5% movement speed buff.

This item is literally a BUFFED BANNER OF COMMAND because it can be built on any champion who has the mobility to get away or 1v1 or even 2v1 with the item and completely shifts the game state over to who has the best hullbreaker champ or who has a hullbreaker champ.

How did Riot even think this item is balanced in any way? Just considering a SoloQ standpoint where you have 0 communication, the item has overbuffed stats, and if your team can't match the push or somehow end the game before the top laner gets the item it will be a nuisance all game until you somehow win or more than likely lose.

There was a reason Banner of Command was taken out of the game and that was because it was a toxic item that forced teams into either having it or somehow countering it which with the introduction of HullBreaker seems even easier than actually stopping a HullBreaker champ.",LV99Zapdos,1697518781.0,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179qkbp/hullbreaker_is_just_banner_of_command_but_better/

new,It's really baffling how every rune/champ/dragon is toned down but Teleport is unchanged,"Teleport is basically does the exact thing on mid lane that it did on top lane before unleashed teleport was introduced. 

Adressing teleport for the early game should have happened last patch when death timers changed. But they didnt change the TP mechanic for early game 

It's the same top lane situation. You are not getting punished for being solokilled early levels but ot rather gives you a favor. You can die and tp back to mid lane on a good wave state and get the gold-freeze. In this form if you pick ignite for mid you are trolling. 

This type of gameplay design favors mages which I would hav nothing against as a Mage player but it honestly feels unfair and removes the fun element of playing mid lane. The excitement and the challenge. 

Surely if you go smurf into iron-gold this won't be as problematic but if you play high enough you will understand how this is the same scenario before unleashed TP as top laners just died, winner pushed lane while the 0-1-0 guy just used TP to get back to lane and set up a permanent freeze.

new,Current state of the game (Jungle/ADC),"**Disclaimer**: My goal is not to generate drama/hate but rather to start a discussion. I'm not the ultimate authority, and I might not be the best player, but I'm here to share my perspective.

Good evening, gentlemen. After playing this game since 2013, I'd like to share my opinion on why I'm not enjoying the current state of the game. I've been playing inMaster as a support for quite some time now, and I've noticed several things that bother me. I wanted to get this off my chest and see if I'm the only one who thinks this way...

1. **Jungle** \-&gt; Literally, every game from D1 and above is solely dependent on the jungle. It's like a best jungle wins scenario. In several games, I've started an experiment of looking at the KDA of both junglers at the end of the game, and the winning team always has the jungler with better performance, and it's always a significant difference. Practically 90% of the games are like this. Basically, the feeling you get is that when you queue up, no matter what you do, it's best jung wins. It's like gambling, hoping for a good jungle to be on your team. As a support, I try to secure objectives and make invades, but if my jungler is not paying attention and doesn't read the game correctly, what's the point of me playing well? In the end, League of Legends has become a game where one person can carry the match, and there's almost nothing I can do.
2. **ADC** \-&gt; Currently, it's the most frustrating lane to play. I've seen numerous games where a 14/3 ADC loses the game and becomes irrelevant. If you don't play PERFECTLY, you can't achieve much, while a Malphite who throws a tire and jumps into your face wins the game. This used to be my main lane, but as time went on, playing ADC became the worst possible experience. Not even when I'm winning I have fun. Most of your game is spent farming and praying to get three items to start making an impact, while a one-item Aatrox is already a god. Moreover, every month, more champions with five dashes appear, making your feeble flash and nothing essentially the same.

TL;DR: In high elo, 90% of the games are decided by the best jungler, and playing ADC is currently the worst experience.

What would I do? I don't know; I'm not a game designer. Riot is paid to solve this, but they seem busy making skins for Lux. Personally, I wouldn't mind if they removed the jungle from the game.",remi-ok,1697508781.0,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179niei/current_state_of_the_game_jungleadc/
new,Patch 13.21 Preview,"[Riot Phroxzon tweeted:](https://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1714095781815390266)

&gt; Overall: Our early indications of how 13.20 has landed have been pretty positive! Players have been appreciating the slower paced games, better fight pacing and reduced snowball out of the early game. Game time is up about a minute and back to where it was in ~Season 7-8. Snowballing is around the lowest level it has been in around 5 years.
&gt; 
&gt; Jungle: Jungle changes have landed reasonably well overall. We think this helps reward junglers who are more efficient and we've been happy with seeing some of the initial movement on the balance of ganking and farming (Smite changes moved a lot here)
&gt; 
&gt; However, the within-role champion balance is off. Some tanks are too strong and a lot of AD champions are too weak.
&gt; 
&gt; We're looking to return the AD ratio to the pet damage and do some more changes to the healing (to move some more back to flat values)
&gt; 
&gt; The jury is still out on whether the power of the role is in the right spot and we'll continue to monitor over the next few days for whatever followup adjustments are needed.
&gt; 
&gt; K'Sante: K'Sante shows some initial promising skew movement being better for average players and worse for Pros. We're fixing a bunch of the bugs that have shown up, buffing him up a bit and we're continuing to monitor the feedback here.
&gt; 
&gt; Rammus: He's just too strong with his heavy synergies with the resist buffs on the pet. Taking him down some.
&gt; 
&gt; Kha'Zix, Bel'Veth, Hecarim, Master Yi: These 4 junglers were disproportionately hurt by some of the changes; a mix of objective value going down AD ratio removal from the pet, Blue pet nerf for Hec. Bel'Veth had additional movement from a set of direct changes. Looking to bring each up by some amount in addition to reverting the pet AD ratio nerf.
&gt; 
&gt; Other Junglers: Tank junglers have moved up quite a bit, which is unsurprising. They'll go back down by some amount after the pet AD ratio is restored and we'll continue to monitor them after this.
&gt; 
&gt; Le'Blanc: After the whole Shiv saga is over and done with, she's landed quite a lot weaker, so we're buffing her back up
&gt; 
&gt; Aurelion Sol: Scaling champions as a whole are a bunch stronger this patch and ASol is one of the biggest movers. We're tapping him down some as a result.
&gt; 
&gt; Briar: Briar has the sharpest mastery curves I've ever seen working on League, and it's not close 😅. People are getting to this point in the curve more reliably and so we're taking her down some.
&gt; 
&gt; Caitlyn: Lethality Cait has been pretty popular amongst higher ranked players for a long time. It's now getting to the point where it's creeping into being her most powerful and popular builds. Lethality Cait doesn't have the greatest gameplay; it's OK for her to have this build, but it shouldn't be close to being the best way for her to play.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr Mundo: Durability style patches tend to benefit Mundo and this patch was no exception. Tapping him down some.
&gt; 
&gt; Jinx: While we want Jinx to have some amount of ""crazy, unleashed"" feeling and having pop offs if she gets lots of takedowns near the enemy base as it gives her a unique thing from the roster (T1 Guma anyone?!), this patch has gone a bit far. We're toning this aspect down, but we still want this to be a strength of hers.
&gt; 
&gt; Runes: We're taking First Strike down a bit more than it was before (benefits disproportionately from longer games) and Phase Rush is a bit strong after we've seen the other rune changes play out.
&gt; 
&gt; Hullbreaker: Finally, we think Hullbreaker is too sharp of an output and are looking to soften its outputs a bit, while still keeping the item ~similarly powerful

new,The state of ranked in 2023 Split 2,"What is the point of ranks nowadays if MMR is the only factor on matchmaking?

I've seen this posted a couple of times on the sub but I'm genuinely curious what the consensus on ranks is at this point on the sub.

Been playing for a while and I understand why the matchmaking system was changed from visible MMR to visible ranks with hidden MMR (to reduce ranked anxiety and people camping at mmr cutoffs), but as far as I can tell, visible rank always had an influence on hidden MMR, up until recently, where they made it so visible ranks are defacto useless. 

Personally, I feel like in the spot that ranked is currently, ranked anxiety can only have gotten worse than it ever was when visible MMR existed and I very much doubt cutoff camping has gone done significantly. 

I mean if a new player loads into the game and sees the opponents he is going up against are 800-1000lp above him (whether or not their mmr is similar) I just cant imagine he is going to be having a good time.

new,K'sante feels trash,"I know that this champion is getting his fair share of hate, deserved too, but i don't think this change was in the right direction. 

I am by no means a K'sante onetrick or anything like that, but he was in my champion pool before the changes. Now i don't even wantto play him anymore, because it is just not fun. Almost all the combos were removed, you can not Q3 + flash anymore, you cant E + tap-W, you cant flash + tap-W and your Q3 expires when you ult. the only combo you have now is (E) + Q3 + W + R. Where is the skill expression in that? Why is riot just killing his entire identity? On top of these removes your passive damage in ""All out"" is reduced to a flat 35% percent increase, which removes a significant amount of damage from his kit, understandable so, his passive dealt too much true damage in the late game, but why are they also removing the damage increase of his W? his W is now at a set damage, only increased by the bonus AD from ""All out"". This W change in particular is resposible for extremely many solo kills not happening, because youre not properly able to finish the enemy off. I do believe Riot needs to revert the W changes, 'cause  If you hit a perfect combo on a 75% health target at level 6, and it does not die it just feels extremely unrewarding. All this is not even considering the fact, that you have to channel your W for at least 0.65 seconds, which often leads to people flashing away, of course, the tap W was probably too fast, but to wait 0.65 seconds (0.5 seconds in ""All out"") on a mediocre damage spell which doesn't even have execute damage anymore feels wrong.

You also can not heal on anything else but champions anymore, the overall healing percentage was lowered aswell, in exchange we got 10% more health in the ""All out"" form. This ""compensation"" only leads to more frustration. when you ult, you lose 85% of your bonus resistances, which means you get oneshot, lowering the healing makes you even more squishy, 10% more health will not help much, coupled with his W and Passive-nerfs, you basically don't heal.

The ATK-speed you get, when in ""All-out"" does not even make any sense, because you have 2 AA-resets in your kit, rendering any excess ATK-speed useless. Lowering the damage when ulting someone through a wall was also reduced, should you not be rewarded for ulting someone through a wall? Yet another skill expression being removed. (AP-scaling also doesn't make any sense lol)

So, what did riotgames achieve with these changes?

1. every K'sante player hates these changes, it removes many skill expressions and very much of the fun factor of K'sante.
2. K'sante is still dashing in 1v5, tanking for an eternity, meaning the most toxic part of his kit was not adressed. he is still an absolute maniac full tank, which dashes into 3 people and knocks them into his team, barely losing any HP. 
3. kill threat is very low, as K'sante's damage output was significantly lowered, while also reducing his defensive measures (Omnivamp, tap-W)

&amp;#x200B;

How could riot have made better changes?

1. nerf passive ""All out"" damage, maybe let it scale with lvl, or just lower the damage increase from 20% per 100 AD &amp; MR to 15 or 10% per 100 AD &amp; MR
2. leave core mechanics like Q3 + flash, E + W and the Q3 after entering ""All out"" in his kit
3. lower overall damage of W, maybe take off some percentages, while still keeping some sort of damage increase during ""All out"".
4. leave his HP during ""All out"" at 55%, while lowering his Omnivamp a little (keep in mind, he can only heal himself up to 55% that way)
5. the lower base health and higher health growth changes were ok, aswell as nerfing Q in the early levels

What is wrong with letting K'sante keep his identity and just lowering his numbers to make him more balanced?

Anyways, I know opinions vary, but I'm still very interested in what other people think.

I'm a bit puzzled, and I'm hoping someone here might be able to explain some of the arcane of the LP system to me. I've read about it, and I understand the basics: winning team steals LP from the losing team, the amount being relative on the rating gap that separates the two teams.

Still, it seems unlikely for several games in a row to be worth... no LP at all ? What happens with the winning team ? Do someone on their side also gain 0LP ? Does it mean the games were vastly unbalanced ? If so, how can it happen three times in a row ?

new,"Why people refuse to admit that Evelynn is broken? Also, why Riot refuses to nerf her?","Evelynn is currently [a S+ tier jungler according to u.gg and is sitting at 53% winrate with a 15% banrate](https://u.gg/lol/champions/evelynn/build). At master and challenger, her banrate surpasses 18%. She also has been an S+ tier jungler for a ton of patches. She is also one of the very few champions which can build Mejai and get away with it due to her massive safety allowing her to avoid dying.

The issue with Evelynn is that traditional form of counterplay against both classes (junglers and assassins) doesn't work against Evelynn.

- Against most other junglers, you can just ward; this will make their ganks telegraphed, allowing you to react accordingly. Against junglers that can either become invisible, bypass walls, or have a long range dash and can gank from different angles (such as Zac, Kha'Zix, Shaco, Kayn) you can ward in other places, even though warding becomes more difficult.
 - This doesn't work against Evelynn. Why? Because she is perpetually invisible. It only works before level 6; after that, your only option is to either give up lane dominance, or risk being ganked by her; Because Evelynn is perpetually invisible, warding doesn't work because you can only use one pink ward, and Evelynn can just gank from other angles, and she will ignore normal wards due to that. You can ward Evelynn's camps to know where she is and guess where she will gank, but that isn't feasible because you have too a limited number of wards to use and it is not just you, but your allies also need to ward her camps, which is a massive level of coordination that you can't find in your average SoloQ game. Also, unlike Rengar, Evelynn can avoid activating her W, which makes her ganks even less telegraphed, even if they will be weaker if she doesn't use W.

- Against most other assassins, you can pick tanks, or bulky juggernauts. They can't be bursted from full health like squishies can, for obvious reasons: health and resistance stacking prevents that. Assassins CAN kill them, but only when they have been significantly weakened enough, or if they are behind enough.
 - This doesn't work against Evelynn. Why? Because her W shreds a percentage of your magic resistance (not a flat amount, so it works even against magic resistance stacking), her E does damage based on your max health (and the percentage scales with AP, unlike most other percentage health mechanisms in the game), and her R does a ton more damage if you are weakened enough. So not only Evelynn can bypass resistances and health stacking from tanks, unlike other assassins, she has a much easier time finishing them off once they are weakened enough. This invalidates tanks as a form of counterplay against Evelynn.

Evelynn is just broken, but people somehow refuse to admit that she is. They say that she is balanced, easily counterable, telegraphed, that only low elo players die to her... None of this is true, as I explained.

Also, Evelynn needs nerfs, but for some reason Riot refuses to nerf her. Why?",Chinese_Squidward,1697499826.0,0,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179kehc/why_people_refuse_to_admit_that_evelynn_is_broken/

new,Average Emerald Game,"Just played this game, and I find it so frustrating that with 83k dmg and 23 kills there is no way in hell im able to carry this team. Toplane had a rough matchup into teemo but still did decent, blitz hit his hooks, zac tanked what he could but often left me and Jinx alone vs rammus.  


Jinx on the other hand did nothing this game, for some reason this emerald player did not think that buying infinity edge was a good choice, so instead opted for Stormrazor.   


Yes I could have built Liandrys to do some max% hp dmg, but it would then hurt my damage against the carrys. How can rammus be able to carry this team just because he is a tank, while the Xerath with 23 kills cant make a dent in his hp?

If it's not a rammus that stand 1v5 and wont die it's a Yone splitpushing with hullbreaker that needs 2+ people to stop. Tanks and bruisers are just too strong to the point other classes dont stand a chance.

In this case we lost in draft, since we would have been forced to pick an adc like vayne with % hp damage or some other champion who can handle rammus since my spells do minimal damage unless I focus my whole build around him and Jinx kills herself if she autos him.

new,List on how to beat every team in Worlds 2023,"JDG: Take away playmaking mids from Knight (ban Syndra in Orianna matchup) , pick ADCs that can clutch (Xayah, Kaisa). Be top-level in macro. You have to understand that they lose teamfights only via explosive damage/clutch plays. They know too much about stable, slow, and steady teamfighting and draft perfectly around that. 

Phalanx formation around Ruler is nigh impossible to beat in Bo5, but smashable in Bo3 because they always experiment their vanguards/playmaker champion drafts against the style of a certain team



BLG: Do not overshove your lanes. No hitting/skirmishes when your HP is lower than them. Slow down Bin (if he isnt winning trades) = BLG slows down completely. Beat them by tracking where XUN is at all times. As they need XUN to start deathballs and stress out teams. 




LNG: Ban Scout Azir, GALA Kaisa+Xayah. Do JDG/Gen.G Phalanx formation where you protect ADC. Do not do flippy skirmish around GALA early. As their draft indexes on rolling from the botlane. 



WBG: Ban Weiwei Rell, Light Kaisa. Their botlane cannot win in isolation. TheShy will always give you gank windows because he will always trade: his whole philosophy revolves around: ""me higher HP than you, we fight because me better"". Pick hard punish champs with a lot of CC to prevent Light and Xiaohu from having sparks of genius. If not, draft to smash botlane. 



GEN.G: Draft to run at them. Draft a Composition where if your team has higher hp pools  - - &gt; Gen.G will get rolled. As much as Peanut cheeses, the way Gen.G wins is by damage output. That inherently means you need to have world-class draft creativity and hands. Ban away Sejuani. 



T1: Ban Azir, Xayah. No playmaking.  Play Zeri and phalanx protect. Make T1 play like shit by ganking Faker/Zeus via teleport timings. These two are the mental weakpoints. Impossible to beat if you dont have a toplaner as good as Zeus, as they are the best team in the World when Zeus is confident. But Zeus tilts a lot after lost teamfights (toplaner) and he tunnels on plates, and is thus gankable. they cannot teamfight as effectively when Zeus is dead. 



Catch Keria when he's trying to initiate a fight. The danger in lane is Keria, not Guma. Their jungler will never overperform against top teams because his jungle pathing is the most studied in the East as he always grinds and exposes his pathing in soloq



KT: They like setting vision traps everywhere. Trap them as they are trying to trap you. Play 4 group - 1 split drafts. Make sure your toplaner can pass the Kiin Test. 



Damwon: Read and adapt in the middle of the game, not before. What Canyon does tells what lane you should smash. Weak top and botside. Stay even. They get nervous when they are not ahead. If you are JDG/LNG/T1/GEN.G, Deft's brain gets overloaded with macro decisions, and cannot shotcall mid game as it is more important to focus on staying alice as ADC. Make simultaneous cross map actions - multiple things happening on the map via skirmish drafts are one of the easy ways to exploit Deft's role in the team. 



G2: An interesting approach is to win is picking offmeta and smashing lane. Smashing lane is enough to shake how they draft. They will respect Eastern draft philosophy too much and try to copy it and forget their own style. Completely forgetting that they just got hands diffed/ they didnt press their buttons right, and overindex on draft. 



MAD: Hylissang does not care about the cost of death. He only cares about momentum. Play defensive and trap him. Your gold will accrue. They are inefficient and cannot play slow. Cannot play slow = throw. Everyone else gets jebaited easily in teamfights



BDS: Weak early game laning and macro. Do not flip when taking objectives. Either phalanx, or just avoid fighting and crossmap. They will passively lose out via their inefficient macro. Suffocate with wallets, not objective flips. 



NRG: If you're a top eastern team, you probably will know how to download them and get in their heads. Best teamfighting team in NA. But NA does not know enough about LoL to be a threat. They lack info. Will smash you if you try to statcheck them recklessly tho. 



TL: Good at Bo1s because they will always draft more damage than you. They dont give a fck about balanced compositions. More damage = easier to win fights = easier to capitalize on throws. 

But since they draft like this, they are useless early game. Smash lane. 



C9: ADC centric team. Will probably have issues against Jax/Gangplank top players as they will always overindex. And their botside is afraid to take risks against Eastern teams. 

Start dragon if you are an Eastern team. It will always be free. 

EMENES has weak laning form currently. Exploit. 



GAM: Actually drafts better than 75% of the teams. But the macro knowledge/game experience may not be there. Basically, will not be able to play from behind vs top tier teams. If they are behind, they do not know angles = you win easily.

new,Shared minion XP should be refunded to non-junglers,"TLDR: Jungler XP penalties should not reduce the total XP received by the team

&amp;#x200B;

Junglers receive less XP from lane minions prior to 20 minutes. As I understand it, this amount is calculated *after* the XP share is calculated. In the current state, this means that junglers sharing any lane XP prior to 20 minutes actually *reduces* the total XP that your team receives.

Here are a few scenarios where this is problematic:

* Helping a laner shove out a wave after a successful gank -- especially with reduced respawn timers, repairing wave state prior to recalling is more important than ever. Historically, laners were usually happy to share this XP with a jungler in exchange for a better wave state and time to recall, but if the XP received by the jungler does not make up for the XP lost by sharing, the team that ""won"" the exchange will suffer. 
* Helping a losing laner (breaking a freeze, maybe even defending dives?) -- in situations where a laner is already behind, they will often request help from the jungler to mitigate the damage of a losing lane. When a team is already at a disadvantage, junglers who chose to help a laner actually end up reducing their team's total XP, even before considering the opportunity cost of losing camps / objectives elsewhere on the map.
* When losing towers / inhibitors -- as towers / inhibitors are taken, additional siege minions and super minions spawn for the aggressing team. This provides the aggressors additional map pressure, but also gives the defenders access to more XP as compensation. Defending junglers may lose the ability to safely access the jungle in these stages of the game, and must stay further back on the map with their team. Without access to camps, a jungler is forced to share XP with their team, reducing the total XP that their team receives. 

As stands right now, this mechanic runs counter to the intended behavior of XP sharing -- when members of a team are sharing XP, the total XP pool is *increased*, in order to compensate for the lower overall XP that each champion receives. When one of the champions sharing XP is a jungler, non-junglers are still penalized the same amount for their presence, but the jungler only gets to keep a fraction of the XP they took from their teammates. **If minion XP is going to be used as a lever to balance the jungle role, it should be implemented in a way that does not impact the team's overall XP received from minions.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's put some numbers behind this to understand how much of an impact this really has. For context, solo XP is granted at a rate of 95%, and shared XP is granted at a rate of 116% ([source](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Experience_(champion))). A single wave is \~270 XP for a solo laner, or \~330 XP when shared. The examples below are based on shoving a minion wave, but the same logic applies to any scenario where the jungler is sharing minion XP.

**Impact at 4 minutes**

At 4 minutes into the game, the jungler is receiving an XP penalty of \~56%.

Solo lane:

* If a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave, the solo laner will receive 165 XP, which is a reduction of 38% due to XP sharing, and the jungler would receive 44% of that, which is 73 XP.
* The team will receive 238 total XP, which is 12% less than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all, and 28% less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

Bot lane:

* If a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave, each bot laner will receive 110 XP, which is a reduction of 33% due to XP sharing, and the jungler will receive 44% of that, which is 48 XP.
* The team will receive 268 total XP, which is 19% less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all, or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave. 

**Impact at 6 minutes**

At 6 minutes into the game, the jungler is receiving an XP penalty of \~50%.

Solo lane:

* If a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave, the solo laner will receive 165 XP, which is a reduction of 38% due to XP sharing, and the jungler would receive 50% of that, which is 83 XP.
* The team will receive 248 total XP, which is 8% less than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all, and 25% less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

Bot lane:

* If a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave, each bot laner will receive 110 XP, which is a reduction of 33% due to XP sharing, and the jungler will receive 50% of that, which is 55 XP.
* The team will receive 276 total XP, which is 17% less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all, or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

**Impact at 10 minutes**

At 10 minutes into the game, the jungler is receiving an XP penalty of \~35%.

Solo lane:

* If a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave, the solo laner will receive 165 XP, which is a reduction of 38% due to XP sharing, and the jungler would receive 65% of that, which is 107 XP.
* The team will receive 273 total XP, which is 1% more than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all, and 18% less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

Bot lane:

* If a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave, each bot laner will receive 110 XP, which is a reduction of 33% due to XP sharing, and the jungler will receive 65% of that, which is 72 XP.
* The team will receive 292 total XP, which is 12% less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all, or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave. 

**Impact at 14 minutes**

At 14 minutes into the game, the jungler is receiving an XP penalty of \~21%

Solo lane:

* If a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave, the solo laner will receive 165 XP, which is a reduction of 38% due to XP sharing, and the jungler would receive 79% of that, which is 131 XP.
* The team will receive 296 total XP, which is 9% more than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all, and 11% less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

Bot lane:

* If a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave, each bot laner will receive 110 XP, which is a reduction of 33% due to XP sharing, and the jungler will receive 79% of that, which is 87 XP.
* The team will receive 307 total XP, which is 7% less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all, or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How should this be fixed?**

Lost minion XP should be refunded to non-junglers. 

Consider the example of a jungler helping to shove a solo lane wave at 4 minutes into the game. Currently, the laner would receive 165 XP and the jungler would receive 73 XP for a total of 238 XP. This leaves 32 XP that is completely lost just because the jungler is in the lane. Give this 32 XP back to the laner, so they will now receive 197 XP. This is still 28% less XP than the laner would receive if they shoved the wave themselves, but now the team as a whole will not be receiving less XP simply due to the jungle being the one who helped shove the wave.

The new laner XP can be calculated by subtracting the XP received by the jungler from the total XP received if the jungler were not present. For a solo laner, that formula would look like this: solo\_xp - (shared\_xp \* jungle\_xp\_multiplier).

270 - (165 \* .44) = 197

&amp;#x200B;

**In the current state, how can I mitigate the impact of jungle XP penalties on my team?**

* Junglers should avoid sharing XP with solo laners prior to 10 minutes. Not only does the laner receive less XP when the jungler is there, but the XP that the jungler receive does not even make up for it until \~10 minutes into the game.
* Junglers should avoid sharing XP with two or more laners for most of the game. The total penalty to the team for a jungler sharing XP with bot lane at 10 minutes is the same as the penalty for sharing XP with a solo lane at 4 minutes! This penalty steadily decreases throughout the game, but does not go away until the jungle XP penalty expires at 20 minutes -- keep those ganks short and sweet!
* When possible, supports and other non-junglers should help fix waves instead of junglers, especially early on in the game.

\-------

First off, if you don't want to deal with a support just take your adc out of bot lane\~\~\~

The proof:

[I'm Karthus. ](https://preview.redd.it/fq7ivfm1hmub1.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c446cc2f7e68713165497f6724207fbe04eda26)

Besides the memes of the fact that kaisa can build whatever she wants, I just wanted to chill and finish my placements. My jungler was just mentally done because he just escaped a fiora support to only be stuck with a trolling Jax adc. Notice how Jax is building full armor against a full ap enemy team.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe stridebreaker Kai'Sa was the hidden mathematically correct build that I didn't know about... but  I'm 90% certain my jungle kai'sa was fully intent on running it down and just happened to accidently carry. They were going to go J4, but then said ""fk it, we Kaisa'ing it also over the rift"" (maybe not exact words).

How we won. Kai'Sa continued to just click ""R"" whenever I clicked ""R"" to farm first strike gold. She aced them a few times like that. Eventually enemy got smart and killed her. It seemed like they would finally turn the tides and destroy our base.

But it was a trap. A bait. Kai'sa bamboozled them in one final ""R.""

Meanwhile, yorick tp'd into their open nexus. The enemy futilely tried to recall as they realized what had happened, but then I clicked ""r"" and stopped them all\~\~\~\~

To summarize:

Top: Afk split Yorick

Jungle: Click R, accidently carry Kai'Sa

Me: Afk click R Karthus

ADC: Sprinting Jax

Support: Afk Farming Souls Senna.

So lately my desire to win has been greater than my desire to play x champ. So every pre-select I ask for 5th pick, include heart emoji's, and also sometimes I use ladder swapping. So if i'm 1st pick, i swap for 3rd pick, then once i'm 3rd pick, 4th doesn't mind swapping, then 5th pick.

&amp;#x200B;

My win rate has gone from 44% to 54% in the past few weeks, with some 16-4 w/l streaks. It's extremely effective, but only if you know how to play most top laners, and esp in plat/gold/silver. So if you've been playing league for some years, and like to play all the champs, this is a perfect strategy for you.

I basically just counter pick the strongest counters to my enemy top laner. Only tough situations are if you don't get last pick top (infrequently lately for me), or if they have flex picks. Even including those two limiting factors, they don't seem to effect me much.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stomping every lane, and my skill hasn't gotten better. Just by counterpicking top. The only guideline I use is the champ has to be in the top 3 lane winners. It's kind of dumb honestly how easy every game is now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a spreadsheet with who my counters are.

If they pick: Aatrox, I lock in Irelia/olaf. They pick Camille, I lock in ww/renekton/teemo

Darius: Kennen/teemo/voli/pantheon/jayce

Fiora: WW/GP/renekton/sett

Olaf: Akali/trundle/darius/sett/

Nasus: Voli/illoai/renekton/

Teemo: Naafiri/cass/olaf/yasuo/irelia.

Garen (A really fun one): Ap varus w/Barrier, camille, akshan.

&amp;#x200B;

I assume once I hit like diamond, this strategy will have diminishing returns, because some one tricks will be able to play their champ better then me, but it's really turned around my League experience completely. The only qualification to this strat is that you've been playing for a long time, and are one of those ""I have 20-30+ games on every champ"" kinda player, or know how these matchups go.

&amp;#x200B;

It's way way easier than knowing how a skill matchup goes, when olaf is lvl 4, and jayce is lvl 4, both with ignite. You completely subvert that, because in most of these matchups, it's closer to a 'hard counter' (again, at least in plat/gold/silver), so you win most trades.

Even If I play badly, I still beat Garen with Varus or Camille, or beat Nasus with Volibear, or teemo with Naafiri/cass, or Olaf with Akali. So even though i'm a bit rusty on these champs, it doesn't matter because the matchup is so good. Really great for low/mid mmr players!

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr swap pick for top is amazing. Ty for that feature &lt;3

edit: Can pick safepicks on blueside, like shen...etc if you get last pick.

new,Jungle changes,This may come off melodramatic... but as a low-ish elo jungle main - I don't feel like I have a shot at carrying anymore. I play tanks/bruisers and am a resource/farm heavy playstyle. And now I feel like I have no shot at impacting the game.. I can't 1v1 a laner for the life of me unless they're really behind in which case it's obviously not worth much anyways. Should I just play top lane? It's so coinflip trying to get my laners fed because usually I only have 1 or maybeee 2 that are worth their weight in salt.,nalbee1,1697485600.0,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179etod/jungle_changes/
new,"Teams should get to ban 1 jungler, 1 midlaner and 1 adc in addition to the current 1 ban per player","There is a tension between using a ""global ban"" outside of your role and using a ""local ban"" specific to your role. For instance if you're a toplaner and you ban a strong jungler or you're a support who bans a strong midlaner. So how about if each team could ban one champ from each of the three ""center roles"" without doubling bans to 2 per player (too many IMO).

In S1 each team had 2 bans, followed by 3 bans ""shared"" by the whole team. The current sweet spot of 1 ban per player is quite nice. This proposal would take the 3 ""shared bans"" and add them to the current 1 ban per player, as an alternative to the status quo or to doubling the amount of bans to 2 per player (which IMO would be too many).

However these 3 shared bans would be split among 3 roles. One player is given dictatorship of the 3 shared bans, however they can only select a ban that is suggested by the other 4 players.

When a player is in the ban phase, they select several champions to add to a temporary banlist. The UX would resemble the current suggest ban except also show a history of champions hovered over during the ban phase. Banlists can also be saved and imported like runepages, so you won't have to search champions every time. The one they are currently hovering over is highlighted (and perhaps a slightly larger icon that is still smaller than preselect icon).

After a short delay, simultaneously your personal ban is locked in for your team and then suggested ban list is finalised. The dictator is then given 10 seconds to choose from the aggregated ban list. Each player's banlist is at most 3 champions long, so the dictator has up to 12 champions to choose from. If any champion has 2 suggestions (without being preselected) they are automatically banned without the dictator choosing. If 2 champions are tied for the role ban, then the dictator chooses between them.

Why not top and support? Personally I feel like the flavour of toplane is one of uncomfortable matchups and being an island that needs help but cannot receive enough jungler attention or conversely is an island where you stomp the opponent but the enemy jungler cannot afford more assistance. Without worrying about a global ban (e.g. jungler, midlane assassin) you'll always have a toplane ban for yourself. Two toplane bans would harm the lane vibe too much. Similar story with botlane, since it now receives up to 3 bans (2 personal bans + 1 adc roleban).

Rolebans are only eligible for the 50 most commonly picked (or banned) champions in a given role.",SporeDruidBray,1697484177.0,0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179e95i/teams_should_get_to_ban_1_jungler_1_midlaner_and/

new,The 13.20 jungle nerf to AD junglers is unhealthy for the game and makes only AP carry or Tank junglers viable.,"Here is the most important change in 13.20: Jungle Companion Damage: 16 (+10% bonus AD) (+12% AP) (+10% bonus armor) (+10% bonus magic resistance) (+3% bonus health) true damage ⇒ 16 (+10% bonus AD) (+10% AP) (+20% bonus armor) (+20% bonus magic resistance) (+3% bonus health) (Note: the armor and magic resistance changes mean that bonus armor/MR will provide similar damage per gold to bonus health)

**Note: Jungle pet AD scaling was REMOVED 10% to 0%, AP scaling 12% to 10%, and ARMOR/MR scaling BUFFED 10% to 20%** The Pet damage is significant because it is AOE damage and greatly improves clear speed.

https://www.op.gg/champions?region=na&amp;tier=emerald_plus&amp;position=jungle The top 11 junglers (by op.gg's metrics) are currently: Fiddlesticks, Briar, Graves, Rammus, Lillia, Ekko, J4, Zac, Ivern, Evelyn, Maokai.

The highest absolute WR junglers are Fiddlesticks and Rammus with 54% WR (this is a ludicrous WR and junglers with 54% tend to get nerfed next patch or hotfixed).

As of now, the top 11 junglers are all AP except for Briar/J4 who are both ludicrously overtuned balls of stats (and because J4 only needs level 2-3 to be relevant, also note that J4 has been broken for the entire year hitting 54% after goredrinker/shojin buffs then receiving nerfs), and Graves because he has AOE and pet damage scales with armor which he stacks using his E (true grit stacks) during clears.

Notably, **Rammus** is fucking stupid with the new changes because not only does he build a thornmail first (pet AOE dmg scales off 20% armor stacking), but his kit makes passive/W do damage scaling with armor. So he builds full armor and clears faster than a full AD jungler building only damage.... with no downside.

As of 13.20, AP-carry junglers have the fastest clear.

But, stupidly, TANK junglers also clear faster than AD-damage junglers now. Before there was a tradeoff to pick a tank vs picking an AD-damage jungler. Generally, tank junglers clear slower because they have much stronger teamfighting and CC for ganks. Now, they have greatly buffed the Armor/MR scaling of the pets to the point that tank junglers actually clear the same speed if not faster than AD damage junglers, so they not only clear faster, but they have better ganks (CC) and teamfighting, so there isn't any point to pick AD-damage junglers anymore and the stats reflect this.

I.E. if you want a ""carry"" jungler, you pick AP-Damage jungler like Lilia, Fiddlesticks, if you like AA-reliant jg like Viego or Xin you pick Diana/Shyvanna. There is 0 point to play AD-junglers at the moment.",AngryjanitorX,1697481472.0,0,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179d6d0/the_1320_jungle_nerf_to_ad_junglers_is_unhealthy/

new,So what does everybody think of the new state of the Jungle?,"It seems as though the new meta is AP/Tanks with AD junglers being unusually weak with the exception of Graves and Briar. Of note, Hecarim and Bel'Veth are both REALLY weak at the moment.

A new meta seems to be forming within some AD junglers where they will do a 3 camp or 4 camp clear into an early base in order to purchase a Doran's Blade. This is in order to be stronger around the 3 minute mark. 3 camp version of this may require taking Future's Market.

Clearing the jungle across the board seems much slower, and Junglers seem like they're being pushed to lower income, more supportive role. If pros played on this patch I think Maokai would be even MORE prioritized than he is at worlds.

Junglers - how do you feel right now?

Laners - do you noticed junglers ganking less or being weaker overall throughout the game?

* Make the Jungle item scale or synergize with ganking/assists/objectives
* Make Dragon/Herald take more damage when team mates are attacking it within a certain radius
* Increase Assist Gold/Reward + Jungle Item progression/XP when Jungle gains an assist or gives kill to laner
* Nerf CS gold right off the get-go to prevent taxing
* Give JG additional resistances when taking creep damage in the first 10-15 minutes to promote holding waves, easier ganking on less hp",scythecollectibles,1697479440.0,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179cdi2/jungle_role_rework_theorycrafting_discussion/

Twisted Fate is an serious gambler which causes him to play a game of Book of Raw every 5 minutes. After every round, Twisted Fate can win up to 100 gold, or lose 100 gold. The amount of won gold gets doubled every kill Twisted fate has gained. A death will result in losing the doubled amount.

Q: Tripledeck:

""Twisted Fate throws 3 cards at his opponents. Hit opponents get revealed and take critical magic damage. After atleast hitting 2 opponents, this spells cooldown will get a reset because why not. Killing a champ with Doubledeck gives you permanent 5 armor resist for AD Assassin abuser's.

W: All in One:

Twisted Fate crafts 3 cards to one causing the next auto attack to stun the opponent, slowing the opponent for 3 seconds at a 99% rate after the stun, while returning 10% from your maximum mana.

While Twisted Fate gets in a 1.5 second crafting animation, he gets +60% bonus resistances for extreme outplay potential

Twisted Fate is a huge 21 Savage Fan. Every 21st auto attack,  every opponent on the map takes 100 magic damage scaling on 100% ap. If the opponent dies of that effect, Twisted fate gets 21 Gold, 21 permanent movespeed and bascially +21 on every base stat.

new,Light Archer ADC Character Concept,"This is a character concept I came up with a while ago and I was wondering how it would hold up in modern league. It's kind of inspired by the magic archer in Clash Royale. Obviously all numbers would be subject to balance so don't go too hard on those elements. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Passive - Mark of Illumination** 

Damaging an enemy champion with a light arrow marks them for 4 seconds. Attacking marked enemies detonate the mark, exploding and dealing (50% bAD) and granting (25-75 with level) move speed for 1.5 seconds.  

**Q - Arrow of Light** 

Fire an arrow of light passes through enemies, dealing (80% AD + 10% per 20% Critical Strike Chance) damage and extending when damaging enemy champions. 

*Applies on-hit effects.*

 *Attack speed reduces the cast time and cooldown of this ability.*

 *Deals (60-100% based on level) of its normal damage to minions.*

**W - Shining Altar** 

Place a destructible altar that mimics your use of light arrows towards your cursor, dealing 60% of its normal damage.

**E - Grace In Brilliance** 

Leap towards your altar. If you are already near it, you jump in a target direction. After leaping, gain 40% attack speed for 4 seconds.

If there is no altar, this ability resets the cooldown of **Shining Altar** and you gain 40% attacks speed for 4 seconds. 

**R - Sunburst** 

Launch a concentrated orb of light that explodes after traveling a certain distance or comes into contact with a champion, dealing (150% AD) damage and marking enemies hit with a Mark of Light.

For the next 10 seconds, the explosion from mark of illumination will detonate other marks, and detonating marks heals for (30-160 with level). 

*Detonating marks on non-champions deals 20% and heals for 20% of its normal value, but still detonates other marks.*

Worth noting if these are from an early test, they could have been scrapped or changed since then; but interesting nevertheless. 

Specific changes appear to be that the opening to mid from each blue has been pushed back to around the T1 turret, tribrush in top is missing entirely and is blocked off, and Baron pit appears to be far more open, having no terrain around it at all on the minimap.

1. I love Jinx for how straightforward, simple and fair she is. I bet next patch her passive will be changed to something like ""the attack speed part of her passive can stack on takedowns but only on champions not towers, except the first stack."" you convoluted on of the most fun yet simple passives in the game.
2. for normal non challenger players it's already a lot to ask to develope an intuition for jinx attack speed for 1. the minigun, 2. the rockes, 3. minigun with passive, 4. rockets with passive. Now there are so many different high attack speeds that normal people should just stand still and not kite because they will cancel too many autos to make it worth it. Old jinx with rockets and passive was the easiest, most noob friendly version of adc kiting and given that she is the face of league of legends to most people checking out the game i think that is a good thing. just buff her base numbers and revert her please.

There's only magic penetration for AP  
And there's Armor Penetration, Lethality, Armor Decrease for AD. Seriously?  


Since the QoL update where every champion got for a bit more tanky how do you expect AP to compete with AD?   


You need 3 AP items, 25 mejais stacks to be useful as a mage, play pixel perfect, play around your CD, hit all your abilities, position well. Whereas you need 1/2 items on AD without needing to consider anything else, just right click and kite and you're already 1v9'ing.

new,"Right now, a diamond player cannot climb out of emerald","With how wide the skill gap is in emerald, where you have previous split gold 2 sometimes going against previous split d2/d1 players, if you are a diamond 4 or diamond 3 player, you cannot reliably and consistently carry emerald games. You can do well every game consistently. You can outperform your laner consistently. But a diamond 4 or 3 player, right now, does not have the skill to consistently carry emerald games. This is the **only** time this has been true. Previously, if you were a diamond 4 or 3 player in plat, you might struggle for a little bit, but you could consistently carry platinum players versus other platinum players. But in emerald, you are tasked with sometimes (or most times, if you're unfortunate) carrying gold players versus diamond players from previous splits. Right now, if you want the skill to be able to consistently climb out of emerald, you need to be playing **way** above a diamond 4 or 3 skill level. This isn't to say it's impossible to get out of emerald, but you will not get out by playing slightly above the average emerald skill level.  This is **not** a good way to measure your own skill.  In fact, if you're watching any challenger streamers right now doing some kind of ""unranked to challenger"", they shit stomp their way through gold/plat mmr, then when they hit emerald mmr, their winrate goes down to like 65%. Then when they hit diamond 2 or diamond 1 mmr, their winrate skyrockets again. **Challenger players** struggle to carry games in emerald. So, if you are only diamond 4 or 3, you **cannot** consistently carry enough games to climb out of emerald.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention LP gains. Even **if** you were to somehow play at a diamond 1-2 level to climb out of emerald as a diamond 4 or 3 player, it may **still** take you a hundred more games than it should because of how atrocious lp gains are in emerald right now. And LP gains are completely separate from how well you're doing in terms of winning and losing. Oh, you're at a 70% winrate in emerald? Unfortunately +15 is the most you're gonna get!

new,What is the current community consensus on hullbreaker?,"Hullbreaker is currently breaking most elos and it needs to be addressed imo.

Nobody likes facing hullbreaker, nobody likes playing with hullbreaker. Even the people who are abusing it probably don’t like it and would split anyway. It is the most game defining item in the entire roster, more so than any mythic could even dream of being. It promotes a boring, toxic, and shallow play style for all 10 players and requires the enemy team to play much much better than the hullbreaker team to stand a chance. 

You can argue all the points for (gives toplane agency, reward for weakside) or against (ridiculous gold efficiency, ridiculous winrates, toxic playstyle) but it doesn’t matter. It absolutely destroys the league experience for everyone involved.

This got 10 times worse with the snowball reductions so it is so much harder to punish.

According to [gol.gg](https://gol.gg), 369 currently has 356 career wins. This means that he needs 13 more wins to reach his name. 

Right now, JDG has to go through the swiss stage and the knockout stage to win worlds. In order to get through the swiss stage, you need 4 wins, and for the knockout stage you need 9, totaling to 13 wins. The only scenario where it doesn't add up is if JDG gets a 1-2 score in any of the Bo3s in swiss.

I found it super interesting to hear all the BDS chants during playins and especially the chants during the BO5 vs PSG.  


[Korean BDS fans](https://preview.redd.it/lezoj8rdxjub1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2a623587c0574dbda7b5aba29bbe806865ae194)

At one point it sounded like they are playing home and not in Korea. Really interested in the reasons why, since It's been a while since I've seen such big support for an EU team, especially one that is not taking titles domestically.

I know Adam is a big catalyst with the GODS picks and his gameplay and also part of his popularity in Korea comes from SKT Wolf who had praise for his gameplay and unique picks.

But then also rewatching the korean broadcast I noticed there is a big focus on Adam specifically (which makes sense, he is kinda the main pillar in the team and always entertaining).

While Adam is also discussed in a lot of conversations  especially cause of his picks, I noticed that the entirety of BDS seems quite popular and people are rooting for them.

Would love to hear from someone active in korean communities on why do they think this trend started and what are the comments from koreans on the psg vs bds BO5 which was a banger btw.

new,BDS will win worlds. I have proof.,"Just think about it. We have been spoiled before.

It's 2019. There are 3 competitive regions on the world stage, wild cards and NA. The community is split on who to call the favorites. G2 won MSI, Fnatic had two 5 game series against them, Invictus Gaming are the reigning champions, FPX beat them to win LPL, T1 looks scary when they won LCK while the raw potential of DWG and Griffin makes them a contender.

Nobody should've had any doubts who would win after the worlds song was realeased however. ""Fly, fly, Phoenix fly!"" FPX - Funplus Phoenix - was revealed as the champions by Riot before the tournament even began. ""It's time for a new empire."" China were to become the new overlords as demanded by sun emperor tencent.

Why does it matter? Riot released the worlds song ""Gods"". Some of you will say ""Well, actually that would just mean Team Whales vs T1 in the finals so Artemis can face off against Zeus, duh."" And it would be an obvious conclusion. But Team Whales are out. It's not happening.

We were given the key by the casters over and over again to decypher the message. They keep talking about Adam's champion pool, especially his Garen, Olaf, Darius and Sett. GODS.

But there is more. While the song is called ""Gods"", there is a line that reveals the whole truth. ""Once you play god, once play god, they gonna crumble one by one."" The S is missing. Garen, Olaf, Darius and Sett have a 100% win rate currently when played by Adam. Sett however, will turn out to be a false prophet that Adam has to forsake to bring victory to his team. 

The plot armor is too strong, the home crowd loves it and you can make a great skin line out of it. There is no way BDS loses, GOD will lead them to victory.

Instead, if we think of the swiss stage the ""heart"" of the competition before the knockout stage, it is dominated by the major regions except for GAM.

Simply put, I wish major regions all had 3 seeds each and would only give a 4th seed to the region that won the previous world championship.

I understand that the current format strive to guarantee the highest number of quality games, however, we will still have plenty of them once the knockout stage comes and also I think it's really important to give non major regions as much experience as possible to further their development.

I think this will be unpopular because we'd lose the hype play ins run that BDS had and last year a 4th seed won it all but I think giving more exposure and more matches against top regions to minor regions would be beneficial in the long run.",maseioavessiprevisto,1697446649.0,0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1791jup/spoiler_i_think_4_seeds_from_major_regions_is_too/

new,Should new accounts with sufficient pvp games played be included in whole normal blind player pool before they reach level 30? [Serious discussion],"I know that the system already tries to separate new smurf accounts from actual new accounts but it feels like there's a room for an improvement for everyones gain.

I wanted to have an account on different server (EUW-EUNE). 

I didn't buy xp boosts and, for me, pvp is a better learning/gameplay experience than vs AI, so it took me 140 pvp games to get my account to level 30. 
 

I've got all summoner spells in after about first 10 games, and after that there was no in-game difference between this account and level 30+ account (besides bought champions).

I know that normal blind pool includes also players who play a lot of ranked but not a lot of normals, so normal games can still be unbalanced.

The game quickly learns what my MMR range is (in some old Game Developers Conference videos they said around 5?)
On a fresh account, player pool is restricted to mostly players also below level 30. 

Could it be changed to pool new accounts with sufficient games played for MMR certainty, to pool with whole normal blind pool players?

new,The Best LPL Players to Miss Worlds,"There’s always a lot of talk that even with 4 seeds, LPL and LCK have a lot of deserving talent that fails to make it onto the big stage every year. That is 100% true, and today I want to shine a light on some of the players that maybe you will see at Worlds in the next couple years!

Now just to get it out of the way, the entirety of TES could count for this, but you probably already know them (Tian, Rookie, JKL), so I’m just not gonna mention them beyond this. Some of EDG too.

Now the two big names that I feel have to be mentioned are:

**Shanji (OMG)**

I noticed that there were a lot of OMG fans on the English side of LPL this year, and a lot of that has to be thanks to this guy (and also ppgod lmao). The entire OMG roster had a unique and fun playstyle, that wasn’t scared to go in and make plays that could turn games. Shanji is kind of the embodiment of that, and his Rumble is something to behold.

It’s not really certain what will happen to this OMG roster next year as they probably can’t afford to keep everyone, so look out for Shanji joining a top team and making his debut next year.

**Photic (NiP)**

Now although NiP hasn’t been the same since pretty much everyone else but Photic left, he definitely still remains a bright spot not just on the team, but in the entire LPL. The mechanics are there, the carry mindset is there - it’s just baffling why he decided to ask for Zhuo over ppgod as his support. But regardless, I am pretty confident he will get a chance to shine at some point in his career at Worlds!

There are a few more people as well, but it’s hard to say for sure what their future is:

XHR - super hyped up as the next jungle superstar, barely got any playing time

YSKM - went absolute TheShy-esque sicko mode to start his time in LPL, fizzled out really fast. Still has time to prove himself

Shanks - was previously also really hyped up, but maybe proven not to be as good as thought. Looking lately like he might turn that around though",aplacelikehome,1697430372.0,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178xqab/the_best_lpl_players_to_miss_worlds/

I understand that most games need a few matches to determine your skill level and put you in an appropriate rank, but most games will start you low and then work you up from there if you do well.

This was the most miserable hour of league I’ve experienced and makes me not even want to try ranked again. Mostly just came here to vent but also to ask if this is normal and why the game does it this way?

new,suggestion: a better ranked reward system that could reduce ranked solo Q's toxicity and make ranked a more exciting and less stressful mode to play,"picture this: its 2 days to the end of the split and you que for a solo q game to grind towards your goal since you dont have much time left, you get into a game, everyone is stressed out a bit due to various reasons and you know its going to be a hard game; game starts and the enemy invades and your adc dies and right then and there the game is over, why? because your adc is fully tilted and decides everyone should lose

awesome isnt it? yeh... its not

&amp;#x200B;

so why does this happen? the majority of the people know that they will never become a pro player and not everyone wants to make a career out of this game either; so this leaves out a handful of reasons that contributes to the stressful environment of ranked **with one of them being the ranked rewards**

&amp;#x200B;

ranked rewards are currently timegated and riot is reducing the time you have to grind ranked to get the skin + **the chromas that show your achieved rank** in the next split which is going to potentially increase the stress of climbing

&amp;#x200B;

**basically: you don't get your rank = you miss out on content that you might have a high interest in getting it** which leads to toxicity and it usually gets worse around the end of each split which I'm sure most people have experienced it!

&amp;#x200B;

ENTER RANKED TOKENS!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ly6di4znfub1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb2d83734c3f334ec24f17b769b4434023a88e2

what are ranked tokens? they are currency that you get at the end of each split instead of a victorious skin! they resemble the rank that you finished the split in with different colors and can be used to redeem a victorious skin OR a chroma collection of YOUR CHOICE (and if you pick the newest victorious skin it comes bundled with the chromas as well)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s1fad313ofub1.png?width=3180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e919798eec10be9ba4bdbd6f20814da2fdfb66a

the chroma bundle will get you all the chromas (both solo q and flex for previous victorious skins) up to your tokens color so even if you don't get the desired rank you can still try and climb to get that chroma of your choice, and if you want to get the rest you have to grind again to get higher and spend another token

&amp;#x200B;

with such a system everyone will have a good reason to climb now, sure the people that used to just play to get the skin will continue to do so but the rest of the community now has a incentive to try (just a tiny little harder) to get something that they might have missed due to various reasons and it will not timegate content that most can enjoy using!

&amp;#x200B;

you missed out on a sejuani chroma because of x but now you have the time to grind? well guess what you now have the opportunity to do so!

&amp;#x200B;

with such a system the community isn't **rushed** to climb which CAN lower the toxicity overall AND around certain times of the year and with the addition of 3 splits next year I think such a system would be way better than make the game a timesink where if you don't play it due to whatever reason you will miss out on a skin (potentially for your onetrick!) which feels aweful",51934659238,1697405129.0,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178pill/suggestion_a_better_ranked_reward_system_that/

In my 10 years of playing league, i have never seen vision disappear on the same frame the ward dies, it always lingers anywhere between 1 to 3 seconds.

But this time, on the same frame my box dies in the dragon pit, i lose vision of Thresh and it cancels my dagger.

new,Pool Party Ahri is Propaganda by Big Riot,"We all know the ""memes."" If Riot ever made Pool Party Ahri (and/or Lux), it would make them enough money to fund the next 30 seasons of Arcane. However, they have elected to keep it in a ""break in case of emergency"" glass case for if things ever seem dire for the company/game.

Well I'm here to tell you that this is the biggest lie since they said that Nexus Blitz would make a return in 2022.

Think about it, if Riot released a skin that was linked to a state of emergency, even if it was a skin you've wanted since the dawn of time, would you buy it?

Of course you wouldn't. Riot releasing Pool Party Ahri means that League of Legends is dying (for real this time). Another big influx of cash wouldn't be able to help them with any underlying issues going on. Pool Party Ahri is a sign of the end times.

But Riot knows this as they are the ones who fabricated the myths of Pool Party Ahri for their own benefit. They are the only ones who know of this one simple fact: There is no Pool Party Ahri. 

They created the idea of Pool Party Ahri as a way to signify to the player base that nothing is wrong at all times. For all we know, Riot was completely bankrupt at the start of this year which caused all of the problems such as the ""cinematic"" we got. But they had their biggest propaganda piece working overtime for them.

Riot claiming that League would have its biggest budget ever this year did not do anything to ease the worries of the player base. But you know what did? The lack of Pool Party Ahri. ""If Riot was really in trouble, they would have released it by now,"" thought the player base. ""This must just be an unlucky streak and things will go back to normal soon.""

And we all ate it up. We will continue to eat it up. Riot could be 50 billion dollars in debt from settling workplace harassment lawsuits and Pool Party Ahri would never see the light of day.

Because Pool Party Ahri doesn't exist. 

And it never will.",ThatsAToad,1697422000.0,4059,366,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178v8ix/pool_party_ahri_is_propaganda_by_big_riot/
new,Briar in ARAM is a bit absurd?,"Anybody piloting this champion with both hands can take over the entire game.

She has three modifiers in ARAM, including +5% damage dealt, -5% damage taken, and **+30%** (????) healing. This is compounded by her passive which increases healing by up to 50% based on missing health, and further boosted by Spirit Visage or revitalise.

 I understand that the majority of players will kill themselves due to berserk, but later in the game unless your team has infinite CC to stop her W and enough burst to kill her in between E's (both of which heal her for a ridiculous amount) it becomes comically difficult for her to die so long as she's pressing buttons in the general direction of the enemy team.

Well what a banger way to end the play ins! Even though the reverse sweep killed my crystal ball again ;-;. 

* No mountain soul out of the 9 games played today, which is kinda wild. However, all the drags are close, with Cloud slightly ahead. 
* Kai'Sa pulled 5 clear of Xayah on most picked, as well as picking up some needed wins to bring her winrate up to 50%.
* Maokai and Orianna are the most banned of playins with 21 each, though they are not that far ahead.
* We know have 5 champs played in multiple roles, those being Rell, Sett, Poppy, Taliyah and Maokai. Will we have someone in 3 or is 2 going to be the correct answer?
* Most deaths is pretty tight, with only 20 deaths separating 1st and 9th.
* BeanJ moves clear in First Bloods with 4. Crownie is currently on 3, with Labrov and Sheo on 1 each. Have to see how well they do in Swiss.
* Crownie also took the lead for most kills in a game with 13, this would have been enough for 3rd last year.
* We now have 2 categories with results, as GAM is now the team that advanced the furthest from a 2 or less team region. 
* We also now have a reverse sweep, so rip me and everyone who predicted 0. There was 1 last year, so maybe I shoulda learnt?
* No baron steals the whole of play ins. Wild. I'm hoping we see a lot of steal in swiss D:
* Lastly, it's not a crystal ball thing, but we have currently seen 58/164 champs in champ select (So either picked or banned). Where will we end up?

Thanks for a great play ins guys. I'm looking forward to covering Swiss and hope my crystal ball can be saved, cos it's not looking good D: 

I've also added my Pick Em's for Swiss, just so y'all can see them :)

new,"Worlds 2023 Round 1 Swiss Draw Analysis: Winners and Losers, Advancement Odds, Overall Impact","Given I'm a big numbers guy, I made a spreadsheet to simulate the entirety of the Worlds 2023 Swiss stage about a week ago, [which I posted on Github](https://github.com/ChiefDelphi7/LoL2023SwissPredictions). Now that we have seen the Worlds draw and the first-round matchups, I wanted to dive a bit deeper into the draw’s impact: who won, who lost, and how much first-round draws actually impact a team’s chances of advancing through the tournament. 



[I already made a post describing the methodology of the simulation] (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/172emn0/interactive_worlds_2023_swiss_stage_predictor/), but the crux of the rating system is that every team gets a “power” score that the user can adjust based on personal opinions (and biases…). The probability team A beats team B is Power(team A) / (Power(team A) + Power(team B)). It’s a simple system, but it’s been shown to work reasonably well (and quickly) in practice in a number of contexts. I tried to give what I thought was a fair assessment of teams’ relative powers: East &gt; West &gt; Minor regions, higher seeds generally = higher power score. But again, if you can disagree, you can adjust stuff yourself! However, nearly all of the conclusions I draw below are independent of the exact “power” values for each team; all we care about is the order of teams and the strong East / West imbalance.



If you saw the draft and agreed that generally East &gt; West, you would come to the (pretty obvious) conclusion that C9 and MAD were big winners, KT and BLG were big losers, and the rest of the West were small losers for losing out on a chance to dodge the East. The data generally supports this, but the margins of impact are smaller than what I had expected.

3 Biggest Absolute “Winners”:

1. C9 (Advancement odds: 31.4% --&gt; 35.3% (+3.9%)
2. GEN (Advancement odds: 90.6% --&gt; 93.3% (+2.7%)
3. T1 (Advancement odds: 85.0% --&gt; 87.6% (+ 2.6%)

Honorary mentions: JDG (+2.3%), WBG (+2.2%), MAD (+2.0%)

However, this is a tad biased against the West, as we’re measuring odds improvement in absolute terms. When most people think of “improving the odds,” they think of improving odds relative to their original values (ex. “Twice as likely.”) 


When you take this into account, the biggest winners by **relative** odds improvement are:

1. C9 (12.49% more likely to advance)
2. MAD (9.23% more likely to advance)
3. WBG (3.26% more likely to advance)


And in a similar vein, the biggest **losers** are:

1. GAM (***28.97%*** less likely to advance)
2. TL (17.37% less likely to advance)
3. BDS (16.74% less likely to advance)

with honorary mentions to NRG (-6.2%), KT (-5.03%), and FNC (-4.26%).




However, I think these stats lose the forest for the trees. Look at GEN and JDG, for example. They improve from 90.6% and 85.3% chance for advancement to 93.3% and 87.6% chance, respectively. Their advancement odds don’t improve much, but their odds of ***not*** advancing drop substantially. GEN is 28.8% **less** likely to be knocked out in Swiss. T1: 17.35%. JDG: 15.67%. ***The single biggest impact of the draw is not that C9 or MAD got a western first opponent; it’s that GEN, T1, and JDG dodged eastern counterparts and got a far clearer path to 1-0.*** KT and BLG weren’t so lucky and got hit with roughly 15% ***increases*** in their odds of getting knocked out (relatively speaking). As soon as it was determined that GENG would play GAM instead of, say, WBG, we cut down on a whole lot of worlds where GENG would go down 0-1… and worlds where GAM would miraculously advance. Same holds for BDS.




So where does that leave EU and NA? Frankly, pretty much every region except Vietnam is left with the same number of expected advancing teams as before. Just as before the draw, we expected around 3.2 Korean teams, 3 Chinese teams, 1.1 EU teams, .7 NA teams, and virtually 0 Vietnamese teams to advance. That hasn’t noticeably changed with the draw, at least up to 1/10th of an expected advancement. To be honest, that’s kind of the theme with this draw: “We didn’t get anything particularly crazy with matchups, and no team comes out ahead or behind by any more than 4% advancement probability (in absolute terms).”

G2 vs GAM

NRG vs DK

GENG vs WBG²

JDG vs BDS²

new,"""In Houses"" Idea","Hey guys!

I'm here in peace! I'm in a LoL team right now, and I'm having a conversation with my mid laner about trying to play more Ranked so he would play (theorically) better players and improve much more, than just ARAM and scrims once or twice a week. And this got me thinking, ranked anxiety is a thing very popular, and people actually prefer not to play the game, even tho they want to get better, and there is no real competitive way to do it. LP gains and losses affects everyone, and there's people who don't really deal well with that, so I came up with an idea, that I believe might already exist. What if we use the LoL official discord to create a ladder there. The idea is, people can have decent games, with comms, and the rank is measured in the server, with wins and losses. It doesn't influence LoL ranked at all, but it's a place for people that might prefer to have a proper ""competitive 5v5"" approach, rather than going solo, with no comms, without knowing anything about your mates. 

Is this a good idea? I'd like to know your guys opinion on this.

I currently have: 

All LCK teams minus T1 - heard there were some Faker shenanigans. 

LPL teams minus Weibo - no idea why, there's always that one team from the LPL that underperforms (I don't watch LPL it's just blind roll).

LEC - G2 only. I'd love to click FNC or BDS, but I don't feel like LEC is as strong as it was in 2017 or so. New FNC without Rekkles feel reckless.

LCS - historically all LCS teams suck beside C9 which field EMENES, so it's kind of a case of itself. NRG look very favored to me, but I have no hope for LCS due to their international performance and Golden Guardians fiasco I saw before play-ins.

It was the game where I had 20+ kills and assists. As you can see, I play Xerath in almost all of my games (and lose mostly when I play Jungler because I suck at Jungling lol).

Teammate told me at the end of the game that I was hitting all my combos too flawlessly. I mean, it's not hard to combo with Xerath, right? Farm enough for full AP, hit a stun and spam W then Q. If you don't land the stun, wait for the stun CD, or poke the enemies with Q.

Anywho, enemy team was squishy against my AP, so my single Q basically took away half their HP, with W to finish the kill.

I used as input the first round team pairings and two tables for Bo1 and Bo3 winning odds for every pair of teams (the table can assume different red-blue odds per match-up). I added a restriction such that two teams cannot play each other more than once (I couldn't find the complete rule set after a quick search, but this is a standard restrictions in Swiss tournaments). I used my personal bias to create these tables so take any results with a pinch of salt.

As a short description of my bias: I gave CN teams slight odds of winning vs their KR counterparts, but also a bit of a higher chance of losing to weaker opponents. I considered EU teams a bit stronger than NA teams due to BDS winning 3-0 vs GG. Also, my Bo1 winning chances are closer to 50% than the Bo3 chances for most match-ups (I didn't consider any match-up to flip odds for a Bo1, but I think teams like GAM have significantly better odds in a Bo1 than Bo3s).

Parting thoughts: I found it particularly interesting that MAD got higher chances than FNC to classify, since I had MAD's chances of winning each pairing lower or equal to FNC's. I guess the first match-up really makes a difference.

Good luck with your Pick-ems!

new,"I think the biggest issue with hated modern champions is that they tend to only ""win more""","Okay let me start by giving an example of the opposite of a ""win more"" champion. Let's talk about Thresh. I think he's a great example because he's generally pretty liked and considered to be good design. 

&amp;#x200B;

In a situation where you are in a winning situation, as thresh you have tools that allow you to win more. Good hooks, aggressive abilities, ETC. In situations where you are losing, you have tools that allow you to lose less. Defensive CC and utility, escape tools, ETC.

&amp;#x200B;

Compare this to the most recent addition to the game: Briar. Does Briar have tools that let her win more? Absolutely. Briar is amazing when ahead, even only a few hundred gold. Her kit is excellent for snowballing and gaining traction. Now, the important part, does Briar have tools that let her lose less? **No**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think this tends to be overwhelmingly true for champions released in the past \~5 years who are disliked. They have tools that allow them to snowball hard and carry a lead, but they have basically zero tools that are useful when behind. The characters feel oppressive when ahead, and so forgettable when behind that you don't think about the times you've played against them and won. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even comparing a lot of the less hated new additions to the game: Seraphine, Vex, Lillia, there's a clear trend of all of these champions having atleast a few defensive tools. These champions are absolutley powerful when ahead, but not in the same way as Yone or Samira. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the champions that people HATE tend to be the ones who are oppressive when ahead and useless when behind. ",HalexUwU,1697403167.0,14,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178ormm/i_think_the_biggest_issue_with_hated_modern/

new,The right approach to nerfing jungle,"I think this patch was the wrong approach. 

I think jungle is in a healthy state when the priority for it is: objectives with team &gt; invading &gt; stealing enemy camps &gt; ganking &gt; afk farming. 

This makes it so junglers get to pvp but against the enemy jungler and not against laners. 

How would i do that? 
3 things:

1. make ganking harder
This can be achieved by reducing ward cds. Maybe letting laners start with 2 ward charges. 

2. make invading more rewarding
Reduce catch up xp by alot, make it so if you invade and get the kill, you actually get time to take 1-2 camps. 

3. make jungler be stronger in jungle
Right now laners (especially mid) can invade alot of junglers on their first clear and kill them or at least force a flash and completely ruin their camp sequence. An idea would be to give junglers damage/resistance buff inside the jungle (for the first 10 minutes for example). This way its good if they get less xp/gold than laners. This makes ganking harder, but protects them from invades of non junglers while the enemy jungler can still invade and kill

I beleave this would result in more fun junglers that duel each other for camps and not just full clear or perma gank lanes. 

Right now it literally doesnt matter if the enemy jungler steals a camp. He can be up 50cs and it doesnt make any difference. Its the only lane that works like that. If you top is up 50 cs he will completely stomp the other guy. But in jungle it doesnt matter at all since your only fighting at an advantage anyway",Such-Coast-4900,1697400454.0,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178nsnj/the_right_approach_to_nerfing_jungle/

I wanted to do a fun fan-made short story for the Coven/Eclipse Universe as it's my favourite skin line.

Again, it's meant to be short and sweet, and hopefully, the actual Coven &amp; Eclipse Knights story gets explored some more in the future along with some more skins!

# The Great Resurrection - A Coven (short) Story

The Great Resurrection had been halted for too long. The Coven of the South, led by Evelynn, was busy fighting against Sivir and her Eclipse Knights. The Coven of the West, led by Queen Morgana, was engaged in dealing with the Sun-Eater Kayle’s awakening. The Coven of the East, led by Syndra, was dealing with two unexpected problems: Nami and Janna’s disappearance and Nilah's betrayal. The Great War continued to rage on, and the support from the witches' old gods remained scarce because the slumbering God Queen did not create enough of them before she was sealed away in the Forgotten Temple.

Now, there are whispers of the Eclipse Knights close to summoning their great deity, the Sun-Eater Aurelion Sol, to bring an end to the witches and old gods in this final last stand. Thus, it was up to the Coven of the North, led by Illaoi and the God Queens prophet, who entrusted her to carry her “eye” to resurrect her and turn the tides of this great war.

The Forgotten Temple was a hidden structure located on top of Mount Aveth where the texts of the Great Resurrection and Witchcraft were first transcribed, along with it being the prison of the first Old God, the God Queen Bel’Veth—creator of all her Old God spawns and Mother to all Witches that harness her primordial magic.

With no word from the other Covens and permission from Queen Morgana, Illaoi, Gwen, Karma, and Neeko set out to accomplish Bel’Veth’s greatest task before the Eclipse Knights and their Sun Eater God arrived.

Upon entering the temple, the walls were engraved with ancient spells they’d never heard of before and primordial magic resonated out of each of them. Neeko attempted to place her hand on one of the scribes, but the touch magically burned her mind until Karma pulled her back to reality. As powerful as the four of them may be, this magic was beyond their comprehension, even for the likes of Neeko.

Up ahead was a statue of Bel’Veth in her human form, sitting on a throne heavily guarded by eclectic, powerful enchantments from chains, runes and an impenetrable barrier. Well, at least not in Illaois eyes. As Illaoi held the eye of her god in front of her, it began to glow. Within moments, four giant spiritual vines manifested and wrapped themselves around the barrier, slowly constricting it until cracks started to appear. Then, without hesitation, all four of the vine tentacles combined into one and came crashing down upon the barrier, shattering it and causing it to dissipate.

It was Karma's turn next to handle the runes, but it wasn’t as simple as waving her hands and hand gesturing them away. Each rune had to be dispelled individually, but as intuitive and powerful as she was, she could find the flaws in every enchantment she encountered. With a focused resolve and a short window of time, she tethered one rune to the others and collapsed them all at once.

The chains were next, an easy obstacle for Gwen to overcome, but with a snip and another snip of her giant enchanted scissors against them, they wouldn’t break. Illaoi tried her hand at the chains to break them with physical strength, but nothing worked. Gwen took a moment to ponder the chains until an idea struck.

She then hurled a needle at each of the chains' four corners and began to chant, channelling her powers through her giant scissors. Within moments, a dome of mist enveloped the statue and chains. She stepped into the mist and became ethereal. Holding her scissors to the chains again, she snipped it, and it immediately broke. She repeated this action on the other three until they all were gone. Stepping out of the vanishing dome of mist, she looked at Neeko as she was nervously standing beside Karma, awaiting her turn.

As confident as they were in Neeko and her great power, Neeko was still anxious about pulling off what was required of her next. But her sisters reassured her that she was doing this for all of their sisters who were hunted and killed, and she would be the final key in speaking the text of the Great Resurrection, engraved on Bel’Veths statue. Illaoi gave Neeko her idol. She nodded, and as she slowly walked up to the statue, her form shifted to that of Queen Morgana, the voice they needed to unlock the final enchantment that bound Bel’Veth. Illaois idol condensed into a smaller size, and Neeko placed their god's eye into the statue's forehead. As she began to speak the words, the others could sense the air becoming heavy and cold just from outside the tomb. Illaoi, Karma and Gwen went to uncover what it was.

Reaching the lobby of the Temple, to the right of them was a shattered oversized gold mirror. The pieces of glass on the ground suddenly pieced themselves together and reformed the mirror. It started to glow, and within moments, stepping out of the mirror was the Coven of the West: Lissandra, Camille, Zyra and Leblanc.

To the left of them, a claw-like slash through space appeared and savagely opening the tear wider emerged the Coven of the South: Evelynn, Cassiopeia, Ashe and Ahri. Soon after, a giant flock of black ravens crashed into the lobby grounds and revealed the Coven of the East: Syndra, Akali and Elise.

Illaoi and her Coven were pleased to see the rest of their sisters still alive and well, but the absence of Nilah, Nami and Janna piqued their curiosity. News of Nilah's betrayal and new allegiance to the Eclipse Knights was unfolded. Nami and Janna, however, had set off on their pilgrimage to seek greater power to help the witches in the Great War, and knowledge of their whereabouts continues to be clouded.

Pleasantries were cut short by the arrival of a dark owl that descended before them. Just as it landed and transformed, appearing amongst them was Queen Morgana. Displeased with how reckless the others have become and the secrets others have been keeping, her irritation flourished even more at the sound of her voice coming from deep within the hallway to Bel’Veth’s tomb.

Deep down, Morgana never wanted to follow through with the great resurrection and knew if Be’Veth returned, her title as Queen of all Covens would be relinquished, and she insisted on handling the war in her own way. She immediately took to her owl form and went through the catacombs to stop Neeko.

The moment she arrived and transformed back to her human form, she lashed out at Neeko with a blast of dark energy, but Neeko was quickly shielded against it by Karma who intervened. As the others suddenly arrived in the tomb, Morgana was seconds away from embracing her true form and dispatching all those who would try to stop her. But she was too late, and with the last bit of the ritual spoken, Neeko had succeeded. The statue quickly shattered, and with it, the resurrection of the God Queen Bel’Veth was complete.

Bel’Veth’s human form was benevolent to them all and magically adorned itself in garments. She was depicted as extremely beautiful, with long white hair, pale grey skin and glowing violet eyes. An elaborate black and gold-coloured gown manifested onto her body, and a crown formed on her head. Black and red ravens emerged from the magical walls one by one and collided with her back, creating a long cloak of feathers.

All the witches bowed before Bel’Veth, all of them except Morgana. Unfortunately, she addresses her God Queen so poorly, but Bel’Veth doesn’t think much of it as she relishes her return and the breath of life once more. Before words could be exchanged between the two queens, a loud sonic scream shook the temple, causing the pillars and ceiling to collapse. Karma quickly acted and shielded them all from the rubble.

But suddenly, a shower of stars fell from the night sky and collided with the shield, pressuring it to collapse, but Karma not once showed any signs of wavering. That was until a spark of moonlight fired into the temple and destroyed her shield. As the dust cleared, the witches headed for the entrance and upon reaching it, waiting at their doorstep stood the Eclipse Knights High Priestesses: Lux, Soraka and Seraphine.

The witches laughed amongst themselves as the three stood no match against them and the might of their God Queen Bel’Veth. But it soon became no laughing matter as their leaders, Leona and Diana, suddenly appeared with Aatrox, Senna, Sivir, Nilah, Sejuani, Fiora, Irelia, Rell, and the army of the Eclipse Knights waiting just at the bottom of the temple.

This would be the last stand for the witches; this time, they knew there was no more running, no more hiding and no more gods to call upon. Bel’Veth began to chuckle as her voice reverbed throughout her temple, and she soon began to ascend higher up into the sky as her body started to distort and change into her true form. The enormous and monstrous being floated above the temple and glanced down upon the puny Eclipse Knights that appeared as mere ants beneath her feet.

With her third eye,  she noticed in the distance a fierce storm making its way towards the temple and hidden within that storm were Janna and The Thousand Pierced Volibear at her side. As the armies of the Elderwood continued to cross the bridge of the murky waterways bordering the Elderwood to assist their fellow Eclipse Knight allies here, they were suddenly stopped by the emergence of Nami and her giant sea creature, the Leviathan.

Their armies were no match against Bel'Veth and her followers this time. They had come so far only to fail. But her attention was quickly drawn elsewhere as the Sun-Eater Kayle and, with her, the Sun-Eater Aurelion Sol were descending from the cosmic reaches of space. The end of the Great War had finally begun.

First off there are close fights where this passive compeletly throws the game off balance.  
Secondly, it's not just about winning the fight. She is ending games way too quickly right after a team fight, before if she won the fight they got inhib and backed off but now she can insta remove turrets. In fact after a team fight jinx is able to takedown turrets faster than she takes canon pre fight.

13.20 D2+ ranks based on lolalytics:  51.72%(2.29% gain)    
  
Now she did get 2 more buffs this patch. 100 --&gt; 105 hp growth and slight base base damage and AD ration on ult. 5 seconds off ult as well.  
  
But those buffs alone are NOT strong enough on their own to make it a 2% difference.  
Let's look at some [CHARTS](https://imgur.com/a/GtwN0WL) .  
As you can see she has gotten a MASSIVE boost of **5% WINRATE** in mid game and that is all due to her getting 5 stacks from a team fight and having the ability to end the game at around 25 minute by insta removing turrets.  
   
  
If you look at 15-20 to 25-30 part of the game length you can see a noticeable curve and slightly reduced game times between those times.  
  
Now jinx deserved buffs for sure, she was one of the worst ADCs for sure but the direction of the buff is just toxic.  
No champion should be able to remove turrets with that speed just because they won a team fight that they could have done barely any damage and just got 5 assists.  
  
In fact hasn't jinx's passive has always been an issue? if you give her 1 AD too much she kills 1 person fast enough to turn it into a penta and if you give her 1 less AD then she can't even get any kills at all.",Cumcentrator,1697400396.0,647,239,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178nrxk/it_really_boggles_my_mind_that_people_say_jinxs/

Attack Range: Melee (swipes with their overgrown nails)

**Passive** (**Sadism**): Pestin is drawn to those who are close to death, their autoattacks do **10% max health magic damage** to those under 50% health. **Cooldown: 10 seconds per target**

**Q Ability: Infected Spear** (**750-500 resource**) - Pestin throws an infected spear doing **70-210 (+110% bonus AP) Magic Damage**, pierces enemies. Does 60% reduced damage to targets beyond the first.

**W Ability: Specter** (**400-200 Resource**) - Pestin conjurors a spirit for **5.25 seconds**, during this time- any ability cast by Pestin will be copied by the Spirit for 100% damage. If Pestin and the Spirit both land an ability on the same enemy Champion, Pestin restores 300-500 of their Resource. Recasting this ability will swap Pestin and the Specter's places. **Cooldown: 20 - 17 seconds**

**E Ability: Toxic Aura (400 Resource)** \- Active: Pestin releases a burst of toxic gas from the Reservoir, dealing 65-145 (+65% bonus AP) magic damage. Specter's copy of this ability slows enemies by (20-40%) for 1.5s. Landing Toxic Aura on an enemy champion will reduce the cooldown of Specter by 2 seconds per champion hit. **Cooldown: 5-3 seconds**

**R Ability: Autopsy (No Cost)**\- Pestin drinks from the Reservoir, becoming empowered from its effects. Pestin spawns a Specter where they are, then leaps untargetably to a targeted enemy champion, marking them for 3 seconds. The mark stores pre-mitigation damage done to the marked enemy, releasing (25% / 40% / 55%) of it as Magic Damage after the mark expires. Does 65% AP (+stored damage) magic damage. Recasting this ability will swap Pestin and the Specter's place. **Cooldown: 120/100/80s**

I lied, this is Zed's kit. Does this really sound like the kit of a ""Melee Assassin"" to you? Except for the passive doing magic damage, swap all other ""magic damage"" to ""physical damage"" and all scaling to physical damage. Literally copied straight from Zed's kit.

Zed is not an Assassin, he plays more like an AD Caster than anything.

Fizz has to get right next to you to do damage.

Naafiri has to get right next to you to do damage.

LeBlanc has to get right next to you to do damage.

Yone, Yasuo, Talon, all of these assassins have to be right next to you to do insane damage.

Not Zed though. The honest to god combo is to use Ultimate, then INSTANTLY before they become targetable ult away, throw W and then hit you with 3 Ranged E + Qs. Never once being in danger of you hitting them.

[Note: I didnt order them from left to right in there respective tier, I dont think they differ much](https://preview.redd.it/hlxtv1dmyeub1.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e95a51ead8bad79d265686bd04cccb3db31be97)

Im a high ping player myself, i based my opinions on how they playable they are from a 90-300 constant ping range, incase you want to know i myself play on170 ping constant and no packet loss. Now firstly i think i should explain what i think makes a champ good on high ping. There are 5 main things that are challening on high ping, in no order : Last hitting minions/csing, dodging skill shots, hitting skill shots, executing combos and early game as a whole. 

Now immediately you may ask why champs like lux who are quite skill shots reliant are in the higher tier, the main reason is that they make it up heavily in other categories, so looking at lux,vex,annivia,neeko and veigar they all have  extremely good wave clear and/or an easier time csing, they also arent interactive during the laning phase which means they dont really have worry about landing/dodge skill shots as much. These champs also have cc that which maybe on a skill shot,but if they do land it they dont have to worry about any of there other upcoming abilities since it a stationary target, which is alot better than having to poke/ trade on a constantly moving target. 

In reality though most league players will never get to a rank where high ping ( 100-200 range ) makes the game impossible since its may not exist, Just look at somone like flyerbekk who managed kata on high ping, Azzapp who got to chall on velkoz. So just play what you enjoy and if you want to give yourself the best chance then you still have the freedom to do that.

Over 80% of all of my games consists of premade groups of at least 3 but more often 4-5. Roughly 60% of my games contains a player at least 2 entire tiers above my entire team. 

This has created an environment of complete one sided stomps. In the rarity that my team is the premade or the higher ranked player, my team then does the stomping. Even games are extremely rare.

At first I gave the benefit of the doubt for this situation. Maybe my MMR was high, maybe I was toxic and got in a group of other toxic players, maybe all this stems from the past when all my friends used to play together. The issue is, all that has been over with for a long time. I'm now back to honor 4 and have cut all the things I used to do to get restricted on this account. My friends stopped playing over a year ago and I've been solo since.

So my next thought was okay maybe our normal MMR just matches their normal MMR. That would make a lot of sense if I saw these plat/emerald/diamond players playing an off role or a champion they weren't used to. However, more often than not, not only is this not the case, but they are usually on one tricks or very high mastery champions.

Now for the interesting part. I made an alternate account specifically to one trick a champion for ranked without having all the ranked anxiety on my main account. The result? Games like league used to be. Back and forth leads with interesting fights and a lot of skirmishes. No one sided stomps or toxic one tricks that are 1/2/3 tiers higher than our team. Everyone genuinely working together to win. All the 5 man cheese coming out of a random bush is gone. No more breathing in the jungle and 17 people showing up.

I've put a lot of games in over the past 6 months and no matter what I do, it shows no sign of improving. This leads me to believe my main account has some sort of flag or issue with it to cause this kind of setting.

Is anyone else getting the same circumstance? If so how widespread is this problem? It's frustrating as a silver player to queue up and get a 5 stack with 2 plat+ one tricks on it absolutely wiping the floor with me and my team. What can be done to fix this if it is a widespread issue? Will this issue persist in Riots new blind pick replacement mode?",Morthand,1697398916.0,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178n8ob/normal_matchmaking_needs_a_rework/
new,Follow-up on Irelia and BoRK situation from 13.18 video,"Hi,

This is not a post asking for buffs. This is a sequel to the quick thoughts on Irelia in the patch 13.18 retrospective. Timestamped here: [https://youtu.be/5SCAaOGn8nM?t=1134](https://youtu.be/5SCAaOGn8nM?t=1134) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick** **Summary:** 

* Phreak talked about how Irelia is ""tied to BoRK"", how it would be nice to fix this, but it's no small change (he's 100% right).
* I've interviewed a number of Masters+ Irelia Mains &amp; OTP's and put together a consolidated set of suggestions to help with this. 
* I'm only Emerald 3 myself, so I spent more time just listening and aggregating the thoughts of other experienced high ELO players in one place. 
* This should also improve sentiment laning against her as an ancillary side effect. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is BoRK so strong on her at a systematic level?** (Boring stuff here, skip this.)

* Her actual AD ratios are quite weak (20% AD ratio on passive, 60% AD ratio on Q damage, 13% AD heal ratio, that's basically it not counting W). 
* Instead, her scaling works like this. Innately she has a lot of attack speed, some magic damage on hit, and Q applies lifesteal + on-hit effects.
* Bork giving her all 3 of those things (lifesteal, on-hit, attack speed) makes it mandatory, and essential to function. 
* The %HP shred allows her to combat health stackers, but is actually fiercely strong into squishy champs as well.
* The fact that BoRK can slow too helps her land her E which is icing on top. 
* Lesson 1 of Irelia is always: if you don't buy BoRK first every single game you're trolling.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals** (Feel free to skip bullets):

**1. Irelia's general power is not exclusive to BoRK.**

* She can explore other items first without literally trolling. She is not a walking BoRK who dashes around.
* Currently when BoRK is strong Irelia is strong. When BoRK is weak Irelia is weak. Can cause lots of frustration for both her and opponents.
* Riot can safely change items however they wish and Irelia will not suddenly become OP or unplayable, and remains stable relative to her light fighter cohorts.
* Current model of Irelia's damage and gold scaling is overwhelmingly through on-hit items (BoRK, and to a lesser extent, Wits end). This is why you'll notice she dramatically falls off past the point of obtaining those two items.
* People playing against Irelia will no longer feel like she is full build at BoRK, and don't have to constantly check her items between 8-12 minutes out of sheer paranoia she suddenly became Thanos.

**2. Top lane is more emphasized as her primary role.**

* She can play more like a fighter (her actual role) and less like an assassin (long standing meta adaptation). 
* This was intended by the original 2018 full rework.
* She can of course still kill squishies, but this shouldn't be an effortless affair at 1 item. We're advocating for this being more realistic somewhere in the 2 to 3 item range. 
* The Irelia fantasy is about kiting enemies through a wave with her very long 200 AA range, using Q resets on minions and Autos on her enemies to dance around (she's a blade dancer after all).
* Assassin Irelia game pattern can be something as plain as just Q + E1 (hide it on minion), E2 (champion) -&gt; Q + AA, Q + AA, AA, AA, AA... until dead. This executes pretty quickly, and resembles an Akali all-in instead of extended combat like a fighter.
* She will have a closer power band to her other horsewomen cohorts who are also light fighter carries.
* Currently, her ability to 1v1 at 3+ items on even footing is among the worst of all champions who need to function as duelists, and have power budget invested in sidelaning. Cam, Fiora, Riven, Gwen, and Yone all considerably outperform her at 3+ items on even footing against other top lane champs. She will be comparably worse at one-shotting at 1 item, however, which is more suited to top lane naturally having slightly delayed impact.

&amp;#x200B;

**What shouldn't change** (Free to skip past first bullet):

* She doesn't need her overall win-rate buffed.
* Her buttons should still all feel the same, her kit is amazing, fun, and needs no changes.
* Her W and E should deal the exact same damage. (Q should ideally deal more or less the same minion damage). Irelia players have all the breakpoints memorized for softening up minions to enable resets. This is essential to playing her well and distinguishes the player's skill. We don't want to force players to re-learn the breakpoints from the ground up.
* She should not be a universally safe top lane blind pick, and should have her fair share of uphill battles like Cam/Fio/Riven/Gwen has for instance. (You'll notice even a great Irelia player and someone who would play her to death back in the day like TF Blade has become incredibly stingy with the times he picks her more than ever before.) Irelking predominantly plays her midlane now, and has for a while.
* Teamfighting potency remains the same.
* She still remains a fighter/diver and will look to engage on a target, and deal as much damage as she can. 
* She still fights her way out or dies trying as she does now. She does not have much ability to escape - that's intended. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Suggestions for accomplishing these Goals:**

**1. Q does not apply on-hits from items.**

* Retains the bonus of 4 stacks (magic damage) when cast to keep her passive management important.
* The damage it deals can now scale more from the AD ratio.
* Scaling generically off AD lets her consider many different items. She can also scale more smoothly and less spikey.
* The healing is now less about stacking lifesteal through items, and can scale more from the AD ratio.
* Q can have the hybrid damage profile for fighting tankier targets now more shifted into her passive with a better ratio, and less from specific must-buy items.
* %HP Magic damage is now gone from items, and can just be shifted into Q. We highly recommend having this come online when she is already at 4 stacks to require Irelia to land her abilities. This is both what makes her fun, distinguishes play skill, and also help solve the problem of ""she missed everything and 1 shot me with autos"".

**2. Consider reverting the Patch 12.16 Buff to base MR (Make it 28 instead of 30).**

* Follow-up option to further disincentivize mid lane if needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fun facts** (more boring stuff, feel free to skip): 

1. Irelia was not intended to be snowball reliant like she is now. Riot's thoughts on this from the designers:

2. ""Her kit is very reliable, which leads to uninteresting stat checks and makes her more snowball reliant than she should be."" 2018 rework sought to repair that.  
[https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/champion-roadmap-october-2017/](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/champion-roadmap-october-2017/)

3. Keep in mind to further de-emphasize the snowball reliance, they nerfed her early game power considerably in the change from 5 stack to 4. This was a step in the right direction and it definitely helped. We just need to continue progressing down that path - read here:  
[https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/quick-gameplay-thoughts-june-25/](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/quick-gameplay-thoughts-june-25/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing thoughts:**

Irelia's pick rate peaked at 14% near S12's start, and now is a notch above 7% which is a notable decrease given her popularity. If you're a die-hard top lane Irelia OTP, some games you will be zoned off the first 3-4 waves of minions by Darius, Sett, Volibear, whatever. That's fine, the 2021 mini rework made this the case and any Irelia OTP knows how to play this patiently. What doesn't feel right is being behind against that bully champ archetype, getting your BoRK around 11 minutes (assuming things didn't go to shit), and herald might not be up and plates don't fall for another 3 minutes. You're at the strongest you'll ever be and there's not much opportunity to make it count if the enemy is both favored in the 1v1 and ahead in items, meanwhile you need to be mindful of defending lane. This won't be the case every game, but it can be extremely frustrating to experience. Sorry, but if I'm zoned off 4 waves by Darius where he bases for Longsword + Cloth armor and I'm forced to rebound into him, Irelia deserves a better carrot on the end of the stick than ""Well here's your BoRK bro, make it count or forever be a worse Yone/Cam/Fiora/Gwen/Riven (insert melee light fighter carry champ here)"".

The changes above with the right tunings would likely solve this problem. Dedicated Irelia players want to play Irelia, and not be a walking BoRK. This aligns closely with Riot's pre-season goal of removing mythics to emphasize the power and abilities innate to the champions, and not be ""League of Items"" as the meme goes.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR - If Irelia Q does not apply on-hit from items such as BoRK, 100% BoRK reliance is gone, and future power budget is no longer held hostage.** The actual specific numerical iteration will take some careful tuning and follow-up work from a game designer / balancer.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far :)

new,Crystal Ball Pick'Em - Provisional Result - Play-In Day 6," 

Hello, 

Sorry for not being able to post here yesterday. 

Here are the most notable changes for today:

* BDS reverse swept PSG, sorry for those of you who predicted 0 reverse sweeps.
* Kai'sa is now the most picked champion while Xayah dropped to 2nd place.
* Orianna joins Maokai as the most banned champion and both Neeko and Rumble get on the board.
* Viego makes an appearance as the champion with the 2nd highest WR with 71%.
* Three more champions join Rell and Maokai as the champions that have been played in more than one role: Poppy, Taliyah and Sett.
* The player with the highest KDA category changed completely with all the previous headliners being eliminated from the tournament.
* BDS Crownie is now the player with most kills in a single game with 13 kills.
* TW BeanJ now leads for most First Blood Kills, however as he has been eliminated the most likely leaders are now BDS Crownie and GAM Palette
* BDS Adam and GAM Levi join BDS Sheo as the players with more different champions played (7).
* BDS and GAM are now the teams with most different champions played. If they manage to stay in the tournament for a while, it's likely that they won't be overthrown.
* We now know that GAM is the team from a minor region that made it further into the tournament. So if you picked GAM: Congratulations!
* We have a new longest game: PSG vs BDS which lasted 43:55, just 1 minute and 5 seconds shy from the 45 min necessary for some people to win those sweet pickem points. One interesting fact: Ever since the beginning of the tournament, the longest game has been between BDS and another team.

**FAQ:**

*Why do some categories have only 1 or 2 results?*

I only show ranks that 3 or less players/champions/teams dispute. To keep it simple.

*Why doesn't the image show Maokai as been played in 3 different roles?*

Since last year Riot counted Seraphine, who didn't buy a support item but was played by a support player, as Support i'm using that precedence as a rule. So basically if Maokai was played by a support player, regardless of having bought a support item or not, i'm going to count him towards being played as a Support.

new,What do people think about laser beam Jinx and lethality ult-bot Caitlyn in bot lane?,"I'm sure most people have seen it by now from the countless clips uploaded to highlight channels but Jinx is blatantly overpowered right now from the buffs this patch that allow her to chain her passive where she gets more than 10+ AS and allow you to instantly finish the game if you're close to the enemy nexus. She's currently 51% winrate with a 25% pick-rate that rivals Kai'sa. Riot nerfed Sett before for the same reason that occasionally he built the 'mathematically correct' sett build allowing you to OS people with his W. This is the same situation.

Caitlyn is in the same boat - don't judge her winrate by the crit build, but if you switch to lethality build her winrate shoots up to ~57% with a very significant amount of matches. She essentially stacks lethality becoming a menace as a lane-bully and when she hits 3 items she becomes an ult bot which combined with first strike and axiom arc allows her to snowball gold just by pressing one button. Her ultimate can literally one shot any non-tank in the game. I don't think that's okay, and it makes for a pretty boring playstyle in the botlane.

He’s playing with an underwhelming adc and still finding angles. Game 4 he rotates top at lvl 4 to kill Jax and get Adam ahead. The entirety of game 3 he was finding crazy hex-flash angles and making sure he was aware of his adc and perfect peeled in so many situations. Even in the losses he’s trying so hard to get Crownie gold or peel for Nuc, rotating to Adam to try to get him ahead or help save his lane wave state.  Watching him take the right traps to allow for his team to path, flanking to provide pressure on the enemy carry, and even walk through lanes to pull waves or stop a shove by just tanking for 2-3 seconds.

That's the perfect # to secure all weekly and milestones in old passes and the whole track in the new pass (66,66 to be precise)

After playing those 70 Games, you will end up getting 10.5k XP from playing and 12k xp from Event Missions, which will let you end up on level 56 on the pass.

The TOTAL token difference will also not change after playing more games.(excluding '19, tokens per game haven't been nerfed back then)

\*First and last day of each pass counted as half a day, independent of hours used on that day

If there is not a small 2nd set of missions coming (they usually announce them prior on the event page though) then this post will be accurate. 

On a positive note, the Event is on the longer side this year again, after being relatively short last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish we would finally get some consistency from Riot after passes being around for years.

You can't go into the shop and buy the pass while knowing 100% that this pass will have the same value as the last pass, cause Riot is always trying to sneak in small nerfs, which will add up over years.

new,Female champs with highest amount of attitude,"Trying to expand my champ pool. I tend to play female characters that have pazzazz and are a bit ""bitchy"", not just in league, but in other games too. Started playing last year and currently only playing Samira and Qiyana. Anyone knows some other female champs like them? The playstyle doesn't have to be the same as those 2 (go in and kill everyone), but I feel like characters who are full of themselves are probably going to have an aggressive playstyle.

new,Talk on autofill,"I'm a pretty casual league of legends player, playing on EUW, hit platinum 1 at peak, and I play the game every once in a while in ranked solo queue. For me I always pick either top or mid as my 1st and 2nd priority, as it is the only roles I really know how to play and also have fun playing.

&amp;#x200B;

Every 2nd game I queue midlane, I always get autofilled into a position I have no interest in playing, that being mostly jungle as it is a insanely difficult role for me to manage my lanes while simutaniously being aware of my opponents. It's a hard role that not everyone can get into easily. In those games that I get filled into positions I don't main, I always perform badly. This of course leads to my team getting frustrated by me, which is understandable cause who wants to lose LP over something that's out of controll, making the game less fun for everyone.

Also, if everyone gets the option to pick 2 different roles, why would someone then need to get put into a role someone else probably has as 2nd option, making the 2nd role preference be completely useless?

&amp;#x200B;

If LoL is such a competitive game as it is, shouldn't everyone be allowed to play in a environment of their choosing?

&amp;#x200B;

A game on average takes 20-35 minutes, which is at least at my rank (platinum), way longer a time than it would've took me to queue into a game, which usually takes about 1-2 minutes. So why force someone into a game of which they are most likely not going to have fun? It just leads to more toxicity, and as we all know, League of Legends is already famous for that.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand how autofill can help with queue times, but if you want to get into a game quickly then because you might not have much time to play, there is a option in the queue menu called ""Fill"" that you can use.

But what if you don't mind playing other positions but still mainly want your main position? That's why I think autofill should be a setting that the player can decide on to have enabled or disabled.

TLDR; Players not being allowed into a position of their choosing is hurting the game because it leads to toxicity.

new,How to unlock Adams final form,"We all know Adam has been on a roll with the GODS, making the best toplaners in the world either scared they'll have to or excited they'll get to throw down with him on their favourite island. But let me tell you, GODS is not even his final form yet. I implore everyone at BDS and ofc Adam himself to hear me out here:  


Unfortunately there always have to be some sacrifices along the way, but the Sett will have to go - he just doesn't have a place in my vision. His place will for now take everyones beloved Renekton, lets be honest he may be the most picked champ for everyone but has been a main stay in Adams pool nonetheless.   


Next there will be some intense scrim sessions in which he will have to perfect his windshitter of choice - I am putting in a vote for Yone so we can see some low econ roaming builds in case Sheo makes the mistake of not renewing his toplane visa in time.   


Now THERE we go having unlocked the GODYR. At that moment Trick2G himself will instantly be teleported to Korea and with teach Adam his ways.

new,Turbo/Wild Rift-Like Mode,"I'm just throwing this post out to the wind and hoping for the best.

Besides the toxicity, one thing I tend to see people say regarding why they don't play League is that matches are too long. And with the upcoming preseason changes, I'm worried the average match length will get even longer.

Let me get this out of the way: Yes, Wild Rift exists and it has 15-20 minute matches. But it's a mobile game and people might not like playing games on their phones or they simply don't have a powerful enough one to run the game. Plus, WR doesn't have every champ and skin that PC does.

So as a very casual player of PvP games, all I want is a permanent non-gimmicky (so not like URF) mode like DotA 2's Turbo mode, TFT's Hyper Roll or Valorant's Swift Play. Just the base game mode, but much faster. With this existing, people who want the regular mode to be longer and slower could get what they want, right?

The lack of LPL and LCK's 4th seed in Play-in also makes games much less one-sided. As for the results, 2 teams from the lower bracket make their miracle run and make it out, that was a great storyline to me!

new,[LoR &amp; Arcane Lore Discussion/Spoilers] Accounting for Styraatu in Arcane - Timeline Consistency?,"The dev update regarding lore TLDR'd: Re-convergence of LoL/LoR/Arcane lores to provide consistency,**Skarner lore revamp**, **Frejlord storyline progression**, Less short stories, More cinematics, LoR and Riot Forge (upcoming Nunu game) hinted to have priority, Right now, period of no canon/all canon, **Daarkin Arc upcoming, and Timeline Consistency**. Topic are the last two. I will mention that, since the Hextech:Skarner relations are consistently referenced to in the update, it's likely that the other characters which will be covered next year include: all Frejlords presumably since they will progress the story, the (3+9) Daarkins which will likely be the major event in a rotating game mode, Shaco, Nocturne and Varus changes are now canon because he's more in-depth with the context of the Second Daarkin War. 

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I'll say that this has **happened before**. Secondly, **I like this** idea because it supports my timeline hypothesis of how the lore updates will progress in release:

&gt; Daarkin lore update -&gt; Frejlords update -&gt; Zaun-Piltover connections to Demacia and Noxus (primarily, is Katarina still stuck in Demacia due to the Sylas rebellion) -&gt; Ionian (Civil) War progression.

&amp;#x200B;

ASol already put the **stakes high** in the first convergence; The Ruination broke this ceiling; **The Void** is kind of left feeling like a secondary antagonist now when (the intention is that) it's the one antagonistic device which has *some* consensus of it being the big bad for *all* characters.

**ONTO THE MAIN TOPIC. LAST SPOILER WARNING.**

---

&amp;#x200B;

LoR introduced the **event of a Second Daarkin War** between Xolaani and Aatrox (or their respective factions). There are about 9 new Daarkins with **two to four** of them (will address) within *""Xolaani faction""* (Anaakca, Ibaaros, Taarosh/Naganeka). **Naganeka and Taarosh are the reason for ""2-4""** of them. Note that Naganeka was initially neutral but forced into the faction by Xolaanis enslavement, though defeated by Kayle. Note that Taarosh (who was sealed by Myisha or the previous Zoe during the First Daarkin War in the moment of defeating Xolaani) upon being freed, wished to join Aatrox but was also enslaved. Anaakca and Ibaaros are the two *""willing""* supporters.

&amp;#x200B;

**STYRAATU** is a (Aatrox faction) Daarkin which was imprisoned in what became **Zaun**. She's the funny *""haha harpon""* Daarkin. (She destroyed the ""processing plant"" in her re-awakening from sheer rage against Xolaani.) So the splash art (&lt;a href=""https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/5e/06PZ008T2-full.png/revision/latest?cb=20221007171646""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) shows the Citadel (?) of Piltover destroyed by Styraatu, which should imply that a lot of Zaun is destroyed alongside. The question I have is in the **TIMELINE CONSISTENCY WITH ARCANE**. Since this splash art is yet to be shown as existing, you could draw a presumption that the Second Daarkin War comes after Arcane events or is yet to be shown in Arcane.

new,Pick'em translations for reverse sweeps are wrong and mean different things,"Was discussing with a friend who had the Pick'ems in German while I had them in English. We noticed that the translations are not only wrong, but actually describe different things.

ENG ""How many Reverse Sweeps will there be at Worlds (out of 9 total Bo5s)? "" - means one team leads 2:0 but loses 2:3

DE "" Wieviele Partien wird es geben in welchem das Team gewinnt, das beim erreichen des Matchpunkts benachteiligt ist? (Aus insgesamt 9-Partien) "" - means that the team that is behind when one of the team reaches 2 wins, proceeds to win the series. (So 1:2 into 3:2 is possible)

FR ""Combien y aura-t-il de remontées spectaculaires (de 2-0 à 2-3) pendant le Mondial (sur un total de 9 parties en 3 manches gagnantes) ? ""- same as German, but with the addition that it has to be a 2:0 comeback

ESP "" ¿Cuántas remontadas veremos en el Mundial? (De un total de 9 series al mejor de cinco). "" - Remontada technically only is a comeback, so it could also once again mean go to 1:2 to a 3:2 win

Sadly don't know the other languages well enough to check them accurately!

Not sure how this category can then be taken into account for the perfect pick-ems or % categories...

new,Defensive still abilities power creep,"Taking a look at ""stand still defensive channel"" abilities

To take as basis

Master yi W - 45-55% damage reduction (90% on the first 0.5s), heals him for bit based on ap and can be interrupted 

Orange W - no damage reduction, cc immunity, small damage and obviously cannot be interrupted

Galio W - 25-45% damage reduction plus some ap and Mr scaling for magical damage and half of that for physical damage, gets to move but slower, has a taunt and can be interrupted

So some newer ones

Belveth E - 42-70% damage reduction, applies damage on hit and life steal at 20% (+100%) and cannot be interrupted

K'sante W - 40-65% damage reduction, cc immunity, recast has dash with some damage and displacement and obviously cannot be interrupted

Briar E - 40% damage reduction flat, small heal, recast displacement cc with good damage and more good damage if hits a wall and cannot be interrupted 

Don't know. It seems an increase in the ability to disregard CC and do more shit on top of it just because

And to be fair I lost a match against a Briar, so a bit of post game rant. I saw what I thought was a weird interaction, I was a ulted Volibear hitting her and my Warwick came to fight her too. He feared her and then ulted her and suddenly he was off of her and ult was over. To be fair to us, it's hard to see anything with all the effects and champions on top of each other. But holy shit, is it too much to ask that when champion appears feared on the scream that they be feared and when they appear suppressed that they be suppressed?",dmsniper,1697354834.0,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178a3gt/defensive_still_abilities_power_creep/

new,The Current League of Legends Experience in Soulless,"I'm currently floating around Emerald 2 to Emerald 3 this season as its wrapping up.  


As one of the few people who used pinging death timers, ultimate's, and players after a good play or to create synergy, the new ping system creates an environment that is so unfriendly and devoid of interaction with the team and the game. No all chat, less pings on the wheel, no pinging ally ult's or characters with teammates that probably have team chat completely off or pings off.   


Don't get me started with the rank experience this season. The amount of smurf/alt accounts this season is atrocious. Why are we not tieing accounts with a phone number instead of having these accounts plague normal and ARAM after inting or being toxic? Was this really the best approach to this problem that existed for so long? On top of this, it seemed like many games in Emerald have a mix of a variety of ranks that play together including silver, gold, platinum, and emerald. I'm not sure if this is occurring at other ranks within the game but this has occurred often this season with the additional tier of emerald being added. This has led to many games being ruined from someone being simply outclassed when they go 1/10 for the entirety of the game. It feels out of my control to persuade the match into the team's favor when this is occurring 3/10 games.  


Skins this year have been a rollercoaster. Starting with the ultimate Samira skin, Riot let down and mislead the community on funds in relation to the skin and the overall price of things. Later on, the $200 Jhin chroma incident came up. As a Jhin main, the outcry was well deserved, and the jhin mains on the subreddit were just outright furious at the decision made to lock the skin behind such an egregious paywall. Legendary skins are very inconsistent in terms of quality from skin line to skin line. Coven Nami is absolutely stunning and probably the best skin in recent memory. The amount of detail that went into it deserves praise, but as a skin line is introduced every 2 weeks, it's hard to be excited or thrilled with the product when they seemed rush more times than not.  


I'm glad the mythic system is leaving. In my opinion, it led to a balancing nightmare for Riot and champion item spikes that had made the experience so frustrating to play the last few seasons. The design philosophy around Champions having multiple build paths is almost impossible to maintain properly, as this was the original design concept in Season 11 preseason. We will see if the game can return to a healthier state (Season 10), but many of my friends have already left the game given the number of changes per patch notes needed to fix the item system and the champions in relation to that when it was converted.

new,Suggestion for Surrender Voting,"I've gotten back to playing normal matches after a few years, and my first few games have had intentional feeders. Very obvious trolls who keep running down lane, spam pinging and asking in chat ""where were you guys"".   


So, here is my suggestion : If \_\_\_ player has x amount of deaths before x amount of minutes, they are not allowed to vote on surrender. Now the number of deaths and time could be determined by the player base and / or dev team (maybe using data they have on people banned for inting). This formula could also potentially be used for AFK / Non-participation - \_\_\_player has x amount of CS before x minutes, it can be assumed they are not participating.   


To add to this, if a player is removed from voting, anyone in their party is also unable to vote. This will cut down on people holding surrender votes hostage.  


Again, this could be totally the wrong way to do this, but I'd like to see something done about inting. I've been playing League for 10+ years now, and I really don't like wasting 30-40 minutes because 2 people refuse to surrender after intentionally feeding.   


( This idea is heavily inspired by Rainbow Six Siege's anti-grief mechanism. In the past, 4 stacks would take turns team killing a solo player. Now, if you team kill, you are marked and take damage if you attack a teammate.

My bad on this being so late, I slept in so late after grinding some late night league xD

Some interesting points:
* Shunn claimed his third first blood. Last year the winners only had 6, second had 5 and third had 4. So maybe he's a chance to hang in there for third this year?
* Longest game time changed, however it didn't impact the crystal ball pick.
* A couple of champions are really stinking up the rift in multiple games. Ahri 0 wins from 6, Taliyah 0 wins from 4. Will we see these slowly drop out or will they continue to be picked.

new,"/muteall as a strategy to climb inadvertently contributes to a sense of loneliness and may unintentionally encourage undetectable forms of toxic behavior, suggesting that encouraging healthier in-game communication could be a more effective long-term solution","Everyone is talking about communication in league lately. With the removal of even more pings, it seems like league has become more 'lonely' as some have stated. But there is also one thing that might be overlooked that causes the 'loneliness,' and its the chat.

I feel like constant parroting of ""just /muteall to climb bro"" over the years, while genuine short-term advice, has led to this culture of decreased communication in league of legends. Yes, not being able to see the toxicity in chat can help you to focus more on the game, but is this really healthy long-term? Everyone following advice such as this, especially in ranked, feeds into the 'lonely' factor.

I feel like with leagues new toxicity detection in chat, more players should be encouraged to participate, because toxic behavior in chat can be punished way more easily. Toxicity from chat messages is easy to detect and ban, meanwhile soft inting and ping abusing is not, meaning more of those toxic players would be filtered out over time.

Without the chat, in /muteall culture, people are more likely to express their toxicity through soft inting and get away with it because it is so hard to detect. Allowing these players to type, and get banned, would help in the long run to filter out actual detectable toxic behavior.  


Solution: In a 5v5 competitive game with no voice chat such as league, I feel like the option to deafen your entire team should NOT be allowed. Players who are abusive in chat should be reported and banned accordingly, but meaningful chat interaction between players is CRUCIAL, not only for strategy, but also to fix many of the systemic issues in league that makes the community feel so isolated.",gumayusiL9,1697332689.0,0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17845g9/muteall_as_a_strategy_to_climb_inadvertently/

Now i got to emerald relatively easy but since then it was straight up horrible. I feel left alone all the time no one cares about me and i just get dived and oneshotted. I can carry games if i have decent supporters but that happens 1-2 times in 10 games.
Should i only play certain safe champs for soloq? What can i and should i do if a) my support leaves me alone and doesnt help me at all in teamfights and i will always get dived by a j4 or something no matter what and b) i cant farm anywhere because midlane doesnt want to farm botlane and i cant stay anywhere without getting killed?
It feels like Ashe is the only champ that somewhat works for safety and everything else kinda doesnt?

I started play LoL back in 2013, but dropped it after a few years.

new,Jax's spaghetti recipe,"Just noticed that Riot found some funky ""/////(insert bad word here)"" inside Jax's old code, so of course they had to change it.They need to have everything refreshed and new to re-release the grandmaster at arms.

So now Jax's ingredients are:

* invisible counterstrike
* random non existent W damage
* counterstrike dealing no damage if you recast it
* ultimate passive randomly not playing its animation
* W never playing it's animation
* Voice filter for God Staff and Empyrean randomly not playing
* Mecha Kingdoms basic attack animations are ruined
* Counterstrike dodge interaction not working anymore with some matchups (they worked before)

fixes for some of them for next patch only when he is the novelty of 13.20

Imo they should just revert to the old code since it was perfect

new,How to make Seraphine support actually good.,"Unironically the current changes are not the worst and they do Achieve what they set out do by bringing APC and Support closer. But the current problem is that all that actually means is APC will be just as bad as support.

Because she has a bad support kit.She has a long range Q that is bad for poking and almost entirely used for waveclearing and in teamfights requires AP to be good.

W is way too long CD for being used in lane ( Still very strong in teamfights but Soraka/Sona just do it better) and no real ability to defend 1 person in particular

E requires an ally slow/cc  so throwing it out on it's own is not the brightest idea and ADCs (the few that actually have them) dont always wanna throw them out just like that either.

R is just broken dont have anything to say

My proposition.

Nerf the AP ratio on Q by like 10% instead of 20%  might not even need to adjust base damage**This also slows APC from perma clearing waves at 2 components** because rn she can still do that very early due to the base damage buffs

Same thing with the W heal make it a 0.02% ratio

And **make her Q heal allies it hits**Seriously why has never thought of this. Keep the AP ratio to a bare minimum or hell even give it a Heal and shield power ratio so it needs Support items/moonstone to be good. You can even keep the lower health &gt; bigger heal theme that Q already has.

Then Seraphine actually has a real use for the Q in lane. And in teamfights she can heal her frontline while damaging the enemy frontlineAnd most importantly of all **Support mythics actually work on her.**

The current problem with the changes is that they **remove scaling from a champion class that literally is supposed to scale**. Heal Enchanters have always had insane lategames. Looking at

**Sona Soraka Taric Milio Nami Lulu they have substantial increases in winrate as the game goes on**

So what ends up happening is you have a champion with arguably a worse early game than all of the above. That also happens to be hard outscaled by all of the above. There is only so much of the champion that broken ultimate can carry

**Obviously this is all subject to number tuning but her kit needs a fundemental change for support to both be and feel good**

However, there are some abilities I would rather use on quick cast with indicator, while still using normal quick cast on others, as it is faster (i think?). Is there a way to use some abilities with normal quick cast, and some abilities with quick cast with indicator?

The toggle, ""use quick cast with indicator"" toggles all abilites, and I would like to have an option to just toggle some of them. As an example, on Irelia I would like to use Q and R on quick cast, but E on quick cast with indicator.

new,Isnt jinx passive stacking really problematic,"I mean a scenario that occurs in like 40% of games: your team wins a teamfight and gets to take 1 tower and 1 inhib and then you need to retreat since the enemy team respawns and probably kills you. 

With this iteration of jinx even in the worse case where you lose your passive from the won teamfight before getting to destroy the first tower you get 1 stack from the first tower and 1 from inhib. So you sit at 2 stacks. You can now either take more towers + inhibs or if an enemy comes you just kill them. Basically jinx autowins those situations, gaining 6+ stacks easily. Its really not that rare anymore.

new,Where did the narrative that Seraphine isn't a support come from?,"If I recall correctly, Seraphine on release was advertised as a Mid/Support champion. Bot lane carry Seraphine did not exist until she was nerfed out of mid lane and made more reliant on allies. Seraphine was NOT designed as an AP Carry bot laner! She coincidentally became good at the role after changes to her kit. Is she good at it? Yes, but it is not ""her intended role"". Is she a good APC? Yes. Was she designed as a scaling carry mage? Also yes! But was she designed to farm safely protected by a support and scale for free in the duo lane until she hard carries teamfights? No. I'm not saying that playstyle shouldn't exist (though it is incredibly obnoxious to me personally, who likes facing double enchanter?) but you should be happy that Riot is still allowing it to even exist when it was all in all a happy accident. They didn't do that with Pantheon support or solo lane Pyke.

&amp;#x200B;

As for her not being a support, I don't understand why I see this sentiment thrown around all the time? She has an 80% pick rate as support, and I see people arguing with this as ""it's just randoms who are picking her support, her devoted playerbase is playing her APC"". Ok, but still, 80% of her playerbase literally recognizes her as being a decent support, and she even has 50% winrate to back it up, why am I seeing ""she is LITERALLY so bad as support it's disgusting"" being thrown around under every thread? No, she's not? Her gameplay is still very much supportive. Even Champion Insights: Seraphine mentions this: "" With her supportive gameplay locked, all that was left was to give this pop star some tunes."" Morgana literally has a root and Black Shield and y'all have been crying for Morgana buffs but Seraphine with AOE charm, AOE shield/heal/MS, AOE slow/root/stun is not a support?? Okay.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't like the amount of backhanded comments coming from a minority thinking it should be catered to, it's insane. If you're afraid her win rate will drop in masters, you should be able to learn another champion if you're masters, you'll be fine. I know it sucks your champ is nerfed but like ""who cares about Seraphine support"" is really cope. If anything, people care even less about your toxic double enchanter lane.

&amp;#x200B;

# Summary

* **Doran’s items (and Dark Seal): Overpowered.** Corrupting is shit. Long Sword + potions is shit. **If you are a jungler or a support, get one after your first B.** Riot will likely make them unique with your jungle/support item next patch.
* Jungle: Tank junglers are up while AP junglers are doing fine and most AD junglers are bad now. Riot should bring \~6-8% bAD scaling back for the jungle pet. Briar (OP) and J4 are the 2 best AD junglers and J4 sits around 51%.
* Items: Duskblade is pretty much dead, Youmuus is now back in action. Riot just swaps these 2 around all the time. No clue why they can’t balance both.
* Runes: A few untouched or slightly touched runes like Fleet or Phase Rush are very strong right now. Electrocute is likely niche comapred to First Strike and Dark Harvest. Comet loses power vs Aery and Aery becomes very strong.

Buffs:

* Jinx is back in action and super popular again. The R buff was likely not needed, the P and HP buffs on top of the longer games already help her a lot.
* Milio goes back to the strong side. Similar to Jinx he was buffed a bit more than needed.
* With Ziggs bot is awesome. He is also good mid now.
* I love how Riot buffed Morgana. E nerf and R buff to make her ult actually matter.
* Galio is still the same Galio.

Nerfs:

* Bel’Veth got a hefty nerf and even the crit buff can’t make up for it. Triple nerf in one patch.
* Kai’Sa is down. You definitely feel the Armor nerf.
* Akshan and Quinn are still playable and fine
* ZED!!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Trynda had a bug on his E for \~24 hours. This is now fixed but still influences his data a bit.**

**Jungle XP range had a bug which affected Shaco. Is fixed now, but still affects the stats a bit.**

Jinx is back in soloQ and very, very popular and still strong. With the longer lasting games she already got some help, so I think Riot didn't need to buff her as much in one go.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason I am super happy about Milio buffs, even when he is one of the most passive supports in the game. My only problem is that the Q max was not buffed also a bit, like a 2 sec lower CD at max rank, to make the Q max 2nd slightly better.

I love her buffs so much. For some reason Riot has done a mostly good patch with some key changes to a few champs. Morganas R needed love for so long and the nerf to the E CD is totally fine, too. And she is playable in mid and jungle also.

A triple nerf to her was just too much. Longer games means an early game champ loses power. Heavy nerfs to AD junglers. Direct nerfs to her.

For soloQ Kai'Sa is mostly dead even when games last longer now. 3 Armor gone is a lot. But she can make a small comeback with the right build, and it is not what you think it is. Don't get fooled by Umbral or Kraken. Stormrazor + Fleet is the thing I suggest to you.

new,"Skarner new skills, the new W its a problem.","Hello guys, I come to propose ideas or changes since I really like champion Skarner.

Regarding Skarner's new announced abilities, I really like the champion and play him a lot.  I found the Q ability interesting along with the champion's kit, but adding it to W seems like just a mixture of Malphite, as if to replace the absence of Malphite jg, honestly I found W to be more of the same, a very ugly recycling, it just gives one punch on the ground and you gain Malphite's passive armor, it can change to something more interesting.  E's ability is new, I was excited to test it, a combination of it is from his ult, I'll still miss the scorpion's speed, but I think E will do the job along with the stun like the old one.

 Honestly, this W needs to be changed, in my opinion it's just more recycling, after 2 years of development I think I could think of something more interesting or more fun for the skill, for me it's quite discouraging and boring to see this skill, don't you think?
The idea of ​​W is very basic and dated, typical of a character from 2010, they could put something like an improved rug for Talya or similar to Nautilus's which is a more elaborate version of the same concept, and I think that's the problem with skill, being an idea without redefining its concept to offer a new experience.

new,A Heroic tale from Howling Abyss,"Time to queue up for ARAM, my favourite mode. I have over 10,000 games and counting. I'm a certified ARAM god, my title announces it to the loading screen 6 hours a day as my toaster struggles to connect to games. 40 seconds into queue and it pops, Just for the best as I was getting tired of waiting. 

Pyke. No thank you, that champ is too difficult for me. I look at the bench; Viktor, Udyr, Zac...slim pickings. I prepare to dodge, unwilling to commit my time to a pointless loss, but notice that one of my teammates has been fortunate to roll Ashe. It's my time to shine. ""P-please can I have my queen? :3"" I type in chat. I'm not above being cute to get what I want. I continue to spam trades until I get her. I'm not letting some random play MY queen. My heart skips a beat as they finally accept; reunited at last. It's been at least 2 games since I played her, I was getting rusty. Now comes the difficult part, Dark Harvest or Arcane Comet? I had comet read from my previous game, so I roll with it. No need to change perfection.


We load into game, the enemy team consists of Ornn, Maokai, Riven, Darius, Ziggs. Not a bad comp, but not good enough. I buy my tear from Boris and prepare to farm the enemy teams tears. 

The early levels are uneventful, they never even get within flash range. One more minion to 6, then the show can finally begin. With the swiftness of a cheetah hooked on cocaine, I level my ultimate ability and slam my greasy finger on R. It misses all five enemies, but not to worry. It was a warning shot. I won't make the same mistake twice.

In my eagerness to display my raw talent, I misposition and died. A costly mistake, no deathless challenge for me today. I buy my Imperial Mandate and take the hexgate back to lane. This is where the fun begins. I simply needed my power spike to display my true power. The enemy team cannot dodge my masterful volleys, each one placed with precision. If I played SoloQ I'd be challenger, but this account is for ARAM only. Challenger is lucky I restrict myself this way.

I catch a stray snowball; Riven had illusions of grandeur thinking she could fight me. BoxBox himself would pale in comparison to my secret weapon; as the fool presses R and goes in, I smile to myself. Nice try kid, but I win. I unleash the fury of Thor himself upon my F key, laying down my secret weapon. How does my exhaust taste, Riven? She dies, her dreams of being allowed to play the game fading. Another masterclass from the Murder Bridges #1 player.

The rest of the game is uneventful, we end up winning in 9 minutes after they ff. They tried, I guess. I collect my +12 ARAM LP and click queue again. It feels good to be good.

new,"What is the expectation for Yuumi? As a champion, to people who play her, and play with/against?","At release Yuumi was a ""bad"" in that she was unconventional, and had a learning curve. The difference between a good Yuumi player and a bad Yuumi player was so stark, that it didn't matter if the person playing Yuumi had m7 1mil points on her. The toss up for the adc (who wouldn't know) was too great of a risk.

Yuumi then had some reasons to hop off such as eating a skillshot/cc or to proc her passive which gave mana and a shield. Her passive would lose and then regain mana. Her bonus attack range from her passive would be adjusted, her abilities would get cost, cd, and value nerfs. Just so so much work.

Eventually she would get a mini gameplay update, and with it lost any incentive to actually hop off (exacerbated by a previous change to make her W go on a 5 sec CD when hit with hard cc). Now Yuumi sits at a 47%wr in Em+ with no clear definition (as in why pick Yuumi over another enchanter)

One of the biggest complaints with Yuumi derives from how she's able to support her adc without any punishment. There's no good way to catch out a Yuumi and kill her without her adc dying or her hoping off at the wrong point, which again Riot has removed any reason to.

Yuumi as she is now has low base stats, low attack range, and poor scalings. If Riot wants Yuumi to be played in at least soloQ they *need* to incentivize hoping off, and disincentivize just sticking onto one person. I understand the previously it felt bad for the adc when Yuumi would just go and stick onto the bruiser and leave everyone else to die while she's hitting E every 5 seconds to give a massive heal.

Some ways to incentivize hoping off is having her abilities operate differently while detached, having Yuumi apply a limited timed buff that refreshes when she hops off/swaps between allies, buffing her attack range (something like 550-600), or buffing her base stats. 

So I ask again what is the expectation of Yuumi from all parties? As she is now she isn't balanced and won't be balanced in her current state. I also reject the notion that her W is ""unbalanceable"" (or any ability for that matter) her W doesn't exist in a vacuum she has 4 other abilities, and 4 teammates.",CreamofTazz,1697307162.0,0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/177vgpr/what_is_the_expectation_for_yuumi_as_a_champion/

Why is Riot putting me into matches like this where it's extremely clear that it's not a level playing field. At least 2 smurfs on their team (but I think 3), and we get an unrated player as one of our carries.

I managed to gain an absurd 70 cs lead in toplane very early on, but then ended up spending the rest of the game trying to slow down the enemy team's insane momentum instead of using that lead to give us an advantage. The enemy's macro was so much better than my team for obvious reasons, and the result of that game was clearly up to them. They only lose if they troll.

I understand that they say 30% of your games are unwinnable, but this should not be the case because they've put you against smurfs. It should be because your team is playing badly in a fair match.

The enemy ziggs was flaming the entire game, and started running it down at the end for fun, and we still had no chance because by that point we were so far behind.

As an aside, why do people flame when they are smurfing and know it's a free win? Some people are very odd.",teemo_enjoyer,1697301663.0,0,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/177tkde/the_matchmaking_for_ranked_is_so_crazy_around/

new,K’Sante changes are another example of promoting poor gameplay at the cost of skill expression.,"This champion feels so awkward now, I truly don’t understand who playtested this and thought it was ok. Instead of actually addressing the core of his issues, they only made him clunky to play and added more frustration points for his enemies. 

If I was to make a knee jerk change, I would have hit his mana costs, reduce the survivability of ONE of his abilities, like reducing his shield or reducing his DR in W or reducing his base stats. Even a change like only gaining a shield if you E an ally would be more interesting than what they ended up doing. They made compensation changes that also make him more annoying and rewarding bad play, such as Q still slowing during all out or for some stupid reason buffing the ult damage on not hitting a wall and nerfing the damage of actually hitting a wall. Why are they giving attack speed to a champion who has 3 auto reset abilities? Every change is made to help horrible players and these players will still be bad. What is the point?

One of the selling points of this game has been the fluid gameplay mixed with animation cancelling. A large part of the roster, especially champs made after 2012, have ways of animation cancelling and if you learn how to do this, your dps/efficiency can be dramatically improved. With K’Sante, being able to tap W allowed you to do around 5 different combos and mixing flash into it extends this further. OTHER CHAMPIONS HAVE THE SAME INTERACTIONS. Riven can animation cancel every ability. Yasuo and Yone can reposition their knock ups with flash. Shen can flash during his dash to reposition and get a guaranteed taunt. Camille can use her E to get an instant auto reset and can even flash during her E to react to an opponent making a dodge. Master Yi can tap meditate to reset his auto attack. There are so many interactions you can learn if you just put in the time, but they keep making changes that are aimed to help bad players and reduce the impact these characters have in pro play. Why remove features from some characters, but not others? 

Also, I feel like the developers really don’t understand how these mechanics all come with a cost. Me being able to flash Q3 by definition forces me to work around a cooldown that is tremendous and if I mess up, I will be rightfully punished. Why is that a bad thing???? If I come up with a combo that depends on a high cost spell, I should be rewarded for pulling it off. 

There are too many cases where they change a champion to help bad play and punish creativity and dedication. Irelia, Jax, Swain, Illaoi, and K’Sante are just a few examples of champions getting dumbed down for the sake of proplay and bronze win rates.

I hope they stop doing this and outright revert the changes. Imagine if Jax had to hold his counter strike for 75% of its max duration? Imagine if Riven had to wait for her Q animation to finish every time she wanted to auto attack. Maybe Leesin shouldn’t be able to flash during his ultimate? By the logic they are going with K’Sante, the insec Lee sin ult shouldn’t exist. 

Sorry this was a rant, I’m just tired of these developers making the game more boring and watching passionate mains lose interest really puts me down. I want this game to succeed, but it is clear that the developers do not play the same game.

Edit: these comments really illustrate how bad players refuse to adapt and learn new things. Taking away mechanics from champions will not make the game easier for you and improve your ability to fight these champions. Bronze and silver will still complain about K’Sante.",TheZombieGod,1697304723.0,0,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/177umji/ksante_changes_are_another_example_of_promoting/

Also kind of takes a little bit of playstyle diversity away from champs because with runes you can make a different build / playstyle viable.

new,Theory on Riot's soloQ ranked mechanism,"So as someone who plays for years now, I have to ask if there are people who observe this, or if I am really just observing odd statistical outliers at its absolutely finest:

Riot flags mentally unstable players (tracked by report/chat behaviour/etc..) somehow and groups 2-3 of these together per game in the same team, and/or people who are having crazy win/losing streaks to match them.

I had a 12-game winstreak yesterday where every single game was with absolutely textbook perfect teammates. Sure not everyone was winning lane always, but it was civil teamwork to get wins. Today I lost 8 out of 9 games and it's crazy how toxic my teammates were, especially the past 3 games. I'm talking about deliberately trolling teammates, not moving at all when getting a gank from your jgl as a protest, and general griefing in chat. It really felt so obvious that the game will be lost, not only because we were on the worse end skill wise, but because it was a mental implosion to the point where it seemed as if players were bots.

&amp;#x200B;

new,Jungle is over. Creating player pool from 0,"I've been playing League for about 13 years now, starting in the middle of 2010. I reached Diamond I in 2014 (when there was only like 400 spots on challenger and the rest was D1) playing as a jungler and i gotta say this game is making me very sad.

Riot is changing the jungle in ways I cannot fathom, lowering the skill cap and destroying a lot of techniques and strategies from the role and my theory is that they are doing this because no one wants to play jungle anymore. Bear with me for a second:

I started playing back recently and while grinding back to the high elo what i saw was just so sad. The players always had a way of blaming the jungler for everything (and i guess there are plenty of bad junglers out there) but as a former semi-professional grinding through low elo i was astonished to see the sheer amount of rage and toxicity my team gave me despite them being like gold or plat and understanding nothing of jungle. Everygame you have to mute your entire team or get raged all day.

In this scenario, every day more junglers stop playing. It was easy to notice that support was the least picked role. Everytime someone would get autofilled in this role, but slowly the game started to change and the autofilled role became Jungle.

So, why is riot trying to do with these changes is to reduce the gap between a true jungler and a autofill, or make the game just easier in case both junglers are autofill, so that they dont die 15 time to jungle monsters.

I understand saying that a role requires too much knowledge and trying to change the groundlevel for it, but lowering a skill celling in a competitive game is just sad. Is saying that you don't want people to invest time knowing or studying your game, you just want them to be able to do anything without any effort.It's like removing the ability of a champion attacking after walking because some adc's know how to kite too well and others don't,

In these recent movements, I've seen most of my jungler friends stop playing and I criticized them but now i'ts my turn. I feel like most junglers will drop jungle after this but a lot of players from other roles might get interested, so we'll have to build the jungle role player pool from scratch.

Is this what riot wants? How do non-junglers feel about this? I don't know and would love to hear your opinions, but for me, this game is done.

Riot might as well get rid of the jungle position and turn it into Dota 2. I guarantee that with no junglers, laners just stop crying and play their game. I feel this is the only solution since people won't change...

**Edit:**

Ok, so correcting a few things:

* Sorry for all the laners that felt attacked, it's obvious that it's this dynamic that brought this problem of ""junglers x team"" and this doesn't help.
* I'm not complaining about the latest patch. I'm complaining about all the changes riot has made on the latest months that made the game, as a jungler, so boring. To quote one of the comments that summarizes it well:

1. Reintroduction of catch-up xp fixing peoples bad pathing
2. Invade nerfs making it harder to punish bad pathing
3. Range and leash changes making it harder to kite camps and impossible to multi camp
4. Removed smite heal from camps because too much skill expression (no it was not to nerf overall jg healing, they moved it into camp kills so you couldn’t smite in combat for hp). Also changed from old red/blue smite which had different active effects to the current system where the smite summoner spell is the same and the difference is all passive effects, so you don’t need to think as hard about smite usage.
5. Crab spawns later allowing every jg to 6 camp into crab. Also crab nerfed so they are not punished for getting double crabbed
6. Jg item changes so every jg clears basically same speed now, in fact tank jgs now clear faster, together with invade nerf means basically you never are incentivized to try and interact with enemy jg

new,Why Team W(h)ales are gonna win it all,"From a statistical stand point, we can clearly see that winning Game 2 is better than winning Game 1.

In 100% of the series so far, has the team that won Game 2 won the series.

Where as there only is an 80% win rate for the team winning Game 1.

Team W(h)ales is the only team so far that has deliberately aimed for spiking in Game 2 and it's paying off. Even winning against for fun potential world's winners BDS with this strategy.

In their series, we could see BDS spiked their performance in Game 1 and then started falling off, while the Welsh lads was bing chilling in Game 1 and started playing in Game  2.

We saw them utilise the same strategy against CFO. AND IT WORKED.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously seeing a strategy like this might raise some question marks, for one. When the Orcas are getting into the Swiss stage the first couple of rounds are gonna be in a Bo1 format where dropping the first game for good measure, because it  frankly doesn't matter. Might not be the best strategy as the Game 2 doesn't exist.

But once they get into the lower bracket Bo3s again, we will see the same strategy flourish.

So do you think other teams have been looking at this amazing strategy and is going to try and use it themselves? Do you think GAM has been picking up on this?

new,"I'm Convinced that with the Addition of ""Emerald Rank"" Riot is artificially inflating our ELO to make us feel better","Something I have noticed ever since the Emerald Rank was added into the pool of ranks was that my personal ""Rank"" all of a sudden sky rocketed pretty fast compared to normal. I'm not a super great player I pretty much end at Gold 2-3 every season. (I have ended in Plat 3-4 years ago like 2 times), but as I get older Im not as great and the play styles I use to like doing are not as viable anymore.

That said. as soon as the Emerald Tier was added, I noticed i was shooting up rank super fast, id go from Gold 4 to 2, drop back down to Gold 3 and then shoot to Gold 1 (literally skipping the ranks between and only have played like 7-8 matches for each jump). I thought this was odd, I typically sit at like a 54-56% w/r.

Then a few games later I was Plat to my surprise. But BEFORE Emerald was added the difference between low Plat and low Gold had a different vibe typically, but now I noticed they feel EXACTLY the same. and I've confirmed my suspicions because when ever games ar eover and i look at other peoples ranks im getting people between Silver 3 - Plat 2.

My Theroy: Riot Intentionally wanted people to feel like they are climbing faster or easier as a Placebo effect to make people think they are getting better so they will continue to play the game and not feel as discouraged. But in reality your actually not really improving because the quality of the MMR has been drastically dropped and you are still in the same MMR bracket.

This is similar to how Overwatch will count players who just hit an enemy once or twice as a ""Kill"" for their K/D/A to give them Placebo effect of ""Oh man im doing awesome i have 20 kills"".

new,A gigantic disappointment with RG.,"First of all, I would like to note that I will try to be as respectful as possible in this extra long list of complaints that will be presented below, complaints that not only I have but also other members of the League Of Legends player community have mentioned in a previous post I made on the League PBE reddit.

At the beginning of this year, Riot mentioned that this would be its year with the **biggest budget** of all previous years, which seemed to indicate that as players we could expect to get improvements, incredible changes to the game and also to the champions that make it up.

&amp;#x200B;

**...It didn't happen at any time.**

&amp;#x200B;

As a LAN server player, I'm grateful that the widespread toxicity that has been in the game for years is finally being addressed and this issue is being taken more seriously. But in other things... we feel really insulted and not taken into account.

I will go on to comment on the topic regarding the **skins** of the champions, which is a quite controversial topic and more so since these last two years, which are 2022 and 2023. As I mentioned previously in that post on the **League PBE reddit**, many of us have been able to see how **Ahri**, **Miss Fortune** or even **Lux** receive beautiful skins, with incredible visual effects and beautiful recalls. However, other champions do **not receive** the same treatment and the vast majority are **forgotten**, characters such as: **Samira**, **Yorick**, **Taliyah**, **Syndra**, **Seraphine**, **Orianna**, **Nami**, **Xayah** and **Rakan**, have been treated very unfairly with respect to the latter aspects that have been brought out for them.

About 10 days ago, **Riot Brightmoon** mentioned that some of the main Syndras harassed them, insulted them, and even threatened them because of how **Coven Syndra** looked in the game. Due to that reaction, they solved the problem and yesterday, the **new aspect** in the game was revealed.

The **Star Guardian line skin** pack from Wild Rift to PC with Seraphine and Orianna arrived with visible glitches. **SG Seraphine** was missing many of her movement transition animations, she doesn't do the animation that she is supposed to transition into her walking animation and she also automatically attacks something while she walks.

**SG Orianna** problems with her model and some animations, and they did not remove the robot filter. The effects of **SG Taliyah's** abilities are horrendous. **Coven Nami** is supposed to be a legendary skin and they made no effort to change the details on her skin. Not to mention Yorick's hat and even less the appearance that would be **Samira's ultimate skin**. And Jhin... Selling a **chroma for $200** seems a bit low to me.

Let's move on to **Xayah** and **Rakan**, who have been the most outraged champion pairing lately. When the **Star Guardians skin corrupted version** of them came out, it was requested if Riot could at least release a chroma of them prior to the corruption (because it came out as the skins looked and everyone loved it) and the excuse was that there **wasn't enough** budget available to do such an action. When the **Arcana** and **Broken Covenant** skins came out, **Riot Brightmoon** himself mentioned that future skins of the pair would no longer have a **unique special recall** and that the base recall would remain, their excuse was that a **limited number** of players shared the same aspect for both champions or that the number of people who played them were **minimal**.

Recently with the release of their **redeemed versions of Star Guardians**, they are nothing more and nothing less than a **copy and paste** of the code of their corrupt versions. They only applied recolor and nothing else. Needless to say about their lines in the game, Xayah and Rakan are supposed to be **warmer** in their redeemed versions, and listening to them is like listening to their corrupted versions.

So that makes me wonder, why create threads here on reddit requesting comments and constructive criticism to improve aspects if they don't take them into account? As much as we requested that corresponding changes be made in every aspect, we simply **remained silent**. Every champion deserves the **same treatment** that the most popular champions receive.

And now moving on to **the game** itself, many champions are having problems when executing their **skill sets**, an example of this is that **Diana** has a bug since last season where her passive 3rd AA is delayed to the 4th AA. For two days now, the **rift map** has been having problems, the ground is disappearing, plants appear in places where they shouldn't be, champions can go through rocks. **Tryndamere** and **Illaoi** presenting constant bugs. Someone mentioned that **ARAM** is also showing cracks in its map.

With so many problems in the game not only with the skins, but with the champions and maps in the game, it makes me wonder... Where was that **bigger budget** for this year?

The game is **falling apart** and it doesn't seem important. And despite the complaints, criticisms and comments that can help them see how they could improve it in all aspects, they decide to **maintain absolute silence**. This makes them show that they don't care about **their players**, they don't care about **their players' opinions**, they will simply do what they want because they are used to people paying for mediocre things.

I swear that no one wants to insult you or threaten you, but it seems that it is the only way in which you listen to us, in the most violent and aggressive way. And that is making Riot set a **dangerous precedent**, because they only listen through threats.

Please don't forget that you are the company you are today thanks to your community of players.",VxstayanPollux,1697273397.0,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/177l4nw/a_gigantic_disappointment_with_rg/

new,"Congratulations reddit, Zed is fucking dead","Riot has nerfed Zed with the 13.20 W cooldown from 20-14 to 20-17 seconds, following the patch 12.23 nerf to his Q and E damage and 12.2 nerf to his R damage. The results is as follows:

**In Emerald+ Zed now has a winrate of 48.16%, which is the 5th worst midlaner by WR in his main role.**

Prior to the nerf a lot of people were complaining how as a high skill champion he should have a low winrate, well congratulations he now has a lower winrate than the likes of Akali and Irelia despite having a ""incredibly safe laning phase"" according to some.

The champion is so poor at getting early leads that OnZed has opted out of electrocute ignite even against squishy champions like Zerath and Jayce, saying that he has no kill pressure so taking ignite simply puts him behind compared to TP.

Despite this, Zed still maintains a 36.2% banrate, which is perplexing since many here claim Zed's high banrate is due to the champion being ""OP"". Obviously its not the reason since even at his worst state in years, he still has the 2nd highest banrate in the game.

Zed at full build that still needs to land 3 skillshots to kill a squishy got another nerf when lethality caitlyn can 1 headshot a talon, but apparently thats OK while assassins should not be able to kill with full combo. Yall know jack shit about balancing.

EDIT: Honestly I can understand if you just don't like him, hell I prefer when he's good with lethality instead of hydra. Just don't try to cope and say he's overpowered, cuz he just isnt.",AkinoRyuo,1697269552.0,0,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/177k9e9/congratulations_reddit_zed_is_fucking_dead/

new,Frustration for when my jungler trades a 1 for 1 kill with my laner or takes cs.," I main Yorick, currently at mid plat, so I am trash, I know.  
At this point /deafen is muscle memory, I do not wish to hear a single word.  
As a Yorick, I honestly don't care about score, I've had games where I would go 0/10 and they'd still have to commit at least 2 people on me and I'd end up winning.

Anyways, when a game starts I politely ask my jungler to not interact with my lane. No need to gank, to come hold the wave for me, to push, no nothing. I ask them to not take cs most importantly and then instantly /deafen.  
More often then not, I encounter just the opposite - my jungle would either int a kill or take my cs.  
I know for my own that I perform at my best when I get no jungler attention whatsoever, even if I am being camped.  
So since I am not stealing their jungle camps or interfering with their progress in any way, am I not in the right to ask for the same? The risk is just not worth the reward.

Ofcourse, there is a reason I /deafen every single game, don't need to get into that.

&amp;#x200B;

Within the support role we already have a plethora of high range utility mages: Morgana, Lux, Senna, and Zilean. Within the mid and bot roster the number of utility mages is far more limited. Midlaners have Orianna, Lux, maybe twisted fate. Bot has Ashe and... well really that's about it.

new,"Nashor's Tooth should not be 100 AP, lowering it would help fix Kaisa's balance problems","So this item used to give 80 AP, 50% AS, and 20% CDR. They changed it in season 11 to be 100 AP and 50% AS. 

Having it be this allows Kaisa to get W upgrade on one item and then skip out on it, meaning she doesn't have to really go into AP at all in order to get her W to upgrade, she kinda just picks it up on the way to building more AD items. So instead of her having to do a full hybrid build with at least 2 AP items and 3 ad items and then boots, she goes 1 AP and 4 AD. 

Giving it CDR would also push it back onto other champs that could really benefit from it, like Mordekaiser. Kaisa of course has been going through balance issues as of late with her absolutely insane pick rate and builds changing every month while still remaining meta, but I think this is one of the more build global problems she has with her kit. Imagine if she could be building AP full, and build just 1 AD item like a Ravenous Hydra or something, get her Q upgrade and then just build full AP and get her Q upgrade still. This would be the same type of problem.

Right now, theres the umbral duskblade nashors build going on and of course it's gonna result in her getting nerfed again, but if this specific problem doesn't exist my guess is she'll just move onto the next AD item that fits her best while still only building 1 AP item for W upgrade.",xObiJuanKenobix,1697259016.0,0,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/177hpgd/nashors_tooth_should_not_be_100_ap_lowering_it/

new,Character Concept - Vaylyn the rift maiden," 

Hello, fellow summoners!

Today, I bring forth a champion concept that brews in the cauldron of my creativity: Vaylyn, the Rift Walker - a wanderer of realms, master of magnetic forces, and a formidable fighter in the rift. 🗡️✨

**Weapon Mechanics**:

Vaylyn’s weapon isn’t bound by a single form but harnesses the potential to morph into diverse manifestations, each catering to a distinct style of combat and strategic utilization:

* **Form One, Unchanged**: A solitary shard in hand, while others orbit her, unleashing short to medium range, ranged assaults.
* **Form Two, Bastard Sword**: The fragments unite into a colossal blade, facilitating melee combat and rapid, agile movements.
* **Form Three, Bow**: Half the shards morph into a bow, releasing others as arrow-like projectiles, reappearing after a brief hiatus, facilitating medium to long-range combat.
* **Form Four, Combined**: The shards meld with Vaylyn, empowering her with bursts of vehement magic and intensified magnetic capabilities.

Each form encapsulates a different facet of combat and strategy, providing Vaylyn with the flexibility to adapt to various battlefield scenarios and opponent strategies, thereby crafting a multifaceted gameplay experience.

**Conceptual Design**:

While the fragmented, shape-shifting weapon forms the core of Vaylyn’s conceptual design, it's her ability to seamlessly traverse through the rift, coupled with the magnetic manipulation of her weapon, that makes her stand out. Her lore could potentially weave through shattered dimensions, exploring tales of loss, survival, and indomitable willpower, thereby weaving her into the rich tapestry of the League of Legends universe.  


&amp;#x200B;

\--------

Wanted to share my idea for awhile now so I'm eager to hear feed back!  


\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


 

## Vaylyn, the Rift Maiden

**Lore**:

Originating from the ethereal rifts between dimensions, Vaylyn is a testament to the duality of existence. Having wandered countless dimensions, she's familiar with the balance and imbalances that existence entails. Her hair — half black and half white — serves as a visual testament to her origin; the juxtaposition of light and shadow. Her striking yellow eyes are a manifestation of the rifts she's traveled, each one containing a universe of stories. The tattered black tunic, leather pants, and shoulder cape are souvenirs from the battles she's waged across realms. Her blade, unlike any other, is an embodiment of the fragmented dimensions, held together by the magnetic energy from the core of the rifts.

**Appearance**:

* **Hair**: Half black and half white, cascading down in a chaotic dance of duality.
* **Eyes**: Intense yellow, containing depth and tales of countless realms.
* **Outfit**: A tattered black tunic, brown leather pants, tall boots that have seen much wear, and a flowing shoulder cape reminiscent of the shifting sands of time.
* **Weapon**: A single blade made of fragmented, shimmering pieces. It pulses with the magnetic energy, each fragment representing the different realms Vaylyn has visited.

**Abilities**:

**Passive - Dual Existence**: Vaylyn's basic attacks and abilities have a dual effect, influenced by the current form of her blade.

1. **Q - Dimensional Strike**:  


* **Unchanged**: Vaylyn sends out a volley of shards targeting enemies in a cone, dealing damage and slowing them.
* **Bastard sword**: Vaylyn slashes through enemies in front of her, dealing damage and reducing their armor.
* **Bow**: Fires a charged shard arrow that pierces through enemies, dealing damage over time.
* **Combined**: Releases a pulse of magnetic energy, repelling enemies around her and dealing magic damage.

1. **W - Rift Dash**:  


* **Unchanged**: Dashes a short distance, leaving behind a trail of shards that damage enemies.
* **Bastard sword**: Charges forward, dealing damage to the first enemy hit and knocking them back.
* **Bow**: Leaps backwards, creating distance and dropping magnetic mines that slow enemies.
* **Combined**: Dashes to a target, immobilizing them with magnetic force.

1. **E - Magnetize**:  


* **Unchanged**: Magnetizes the ground in an area, rooting enemies for a short duration.
* **Bastard sword**: Swings the sword in a wide arc, pulling enemies toward her.
* **Bow**: Shoots a magnetic arrow that draws enemies together upon impact.
* **Combined**: Surrounds herself with a magnetic shield, absorbing a portion of incoming damage.

1. **R (Ultimate) - Shifting Essence**:  
Vaylyn channels the power of the rifts, changing the form of her blade. Activating the ultimate allows Vaylyn to cycle through the four forms of her weapon, each granting her different abilities and altering her playstyle.

**Gameplay Style**:

Vaylyn's versatility is her greatest strength. Depending on the state of the game and the needs of her team, she can adapt to various situations. In the lane, her Unchanged and Bow forms allow for harassment and poke, while her Bastard Sword form is excellent for all-ins and trades. The Combined form is ideal for team fights, where her burst of magic can turn the tide of battle.

However, this adaptability also requires a high skill ceiling. Mastering Vaylyn means understanding when to shift between weapon forms, optimizing her abilities in various combat scenarios.

**Quotes**:

* On selection: ""The rifts beckon, and I answer.""
* Movement: ""Every step is a journey between realms.""
* Attacking: ""Feel the power of the rifts!""
* Joke: ""Why did I cross the rift? To get to the other... dimension?""

&amp;#x200B;

For other lanes: **Grasp and Phase Rush users** \[Fighters or Tanks\] got a bump to their winrate: Garen and Dr.Mundo as best examples. But also grasp fighters  Also hard scalers who usually lost most their games due to early snowball are now better like **ASol and Kayle.**

Hi guys.

I've crafted a post that aims to give people some good picks for the 13.20 patch with some additional tips. The champions list had almost 20 hours of intense research. 

The champions listed perform extremly well from Iron to Challenger ( well except challenger since it's always a debate...).

Hope you like it.

new,So what is the point of playing early/mid game scaling champs during patch 13.20. I dont really get it,"Before I continue this post: I mainly play  champs that scales harder the longer the game progress such as Kayle/Kassadin/Azir/Sion/Trynd you name it so this dosent really effect me. This is not a rant

I am just curious.

&amp;#x200B;

here is the thing:

turrets are already fortified and now with this patch  you get less gold from plates

Shorter respawn timer so if the enemy you killed has TP they will  get to lane much faster so they can immediately catchup on you with gold and XP

Runes for mainly duelists has been nerfed such as conq, tempo and PTA

those sweet doran buffs with extra HP + damage allow certain champs to last much longer during laning phase even against strong duelists who can stat check them

&amp;#x200B;

so what purpose does early  champions that falls off later serve?

if the enemy team has any decent macro and just play safe, farm up, dont risk to much it will be very difficult to end the game early and then the game will slowly but surely snowball into their favor. (depending on their comp and yours of course)

Now with 13.20 its much easier to do this.

so are early game champs still worth playing if most games can last for 35-45 minutes?

new,"Why are Lux, Neeko, Yasuo, Yone celebrated for their role versatility while Seraphine is viewed as an aberration?","Role flexibility should not be reserved simply for League’s poster child champions. 

As much as I meme around about the wind brothers being annoying to deal with, I’m happy for them that they can play in different roles if they feel like it. Those players really like the champ, and if they are sick of vsing Sylas mid lane or Darius top, they can go bot and have a different experience.  

Riot is taking in feedback about the state of mages, they are taking steps to balance/adjust champions like Lux, Xerath, and Brand to be viable mid lane with buffs for that role while still taking into consideration their support impact. Neeko can play mid, support, and jungle. Her rework was praised as a successful example of making a champion more flexible and enjoyable because of the increased options she had wherever she wants to go.

I find it baffling why Riot wants to remove Seraphine out of mid and bot lane when they are trying so hard to bring other mages back into other roles. There are arguments to be made about adjusting the power level of Seraphine bot, but the intention to view it as an aberration worth deleting through her Q nerfs rather than celebrated as a carry-type enchanter is sad. Champions should not be shoehorned to work specifically in one place when they already work in multiple. 

I totally get that marksmen players want their own role bot. Aside from a very particular season, I sincerely believe and see how Riot is trying very hard to keep bot lane marksman favored. APC’s are niche but fit a unique role when all the other carries on the team are AD, this flexibility should be preserved at the very least for strategic diversity. 

I fear the balance team is going to double down even if her win rate bot lane is unviable because they will move to other projects. I really worry Riot will call it a day because “lol she’s a girlie girl and that’s what support is for”… even though they specifically made champions like Braum to counter that stereotype and there being so many “cute” support champs already. 

Seraphine should be able to carry in her own way in multiple roles like other champions, if for no other reason than that she can already do so.",solikewhatsupthere,1697241268.0,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/177cdje/why_are_lux_neeko_yasuo_yone_celebrated_for_their/

new,New Skarner concepts hold a lot of visual similarities with a monster from another IP,"Was reading through the roadmap yesterday and I noticed a striking similarity between the new Skarner concept and a monster from another game I've played. I'm not trying to outright accuse Riot of plagiarism here as it's not nearly as blatant as the [Battle Boss Bel'Veth](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/uyfv4x/battle_boss_belveth_splash_art_seems_to_directly/) case, but it runs close enough to be worth checking out.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bezravnis, the Inferno Below](https://preview.redd.it/2bqi8zf3y1ub1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=634e7d210a2c3fff11f2cd3ba878a19004b36639)

**Who is this?** This is Bezravnis from the Pathfinder Tabletop RPG, who first appeared in 2013 in Pathfinder Bestiary 4. In-game, he's referred to as a Kaiju (and they have other great-value versions of classic Kaiju), and spends his days chilling under a mountain range, and only wakes up every 273 years because some comet passes by and that makes him PISSED; he then beelines to some city, trashes it, then goes back to bed.  

&amp;#x200B;

Before getting into visual similarities, there was one significant mechanical similarity I noticed between Bezravnis and Skarner's tentative new kit.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bezravnis' full bestiary entry](https://preview.redd.it/8r84q7vaz1ub1.png?width=1349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=638484ce6e63f39ef7292e2c136be33aad4623e8)

If you don't want to read all that, the biggest similarity is Bezravnis' burrowing charge, in which he can charge an enemy while underground before exploding out of the earth in a shower of debris and grabbing his target, which sounds similar to Skarner's new charge that plows through terrain. That's the only major similarity though, as Skarner isn't shooting living webs at people, or heat rays from his tails. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Skarner idle, for reference](https://preview.redd.it/ko8f3o1xx1ub1.png?width=341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df28e3a1753ec6bd42fc5ca27aaec76023932295)

Comparing to the base skin, aside from both being scorpions, the biggest similarities I notice are the very similar structure of his pincers, and obviously the triple stinger look. 

[Skarner's Desert Scourge skin concept](https://preview.redd.it/r3cbb0rny1ub1.jpg?width=2011&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb4bec1bb4ce80090352d35d3858495423989192)

But if we move to the showcased Desert Scourge skin concept, the visual similarities are very apparent. This version does have some visuals that distinguish itself from Bezravnis though, with the metal bits and a general feel of bulkiness with larger stingers and pincers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I don't really have a big stinger to end on, but I thought it was interesting how close these concepts ran. It could be a Riot artist having trouble with visual concepts for our boy, or they might just be a big Pathfinder fan.

new,I love how competitive Solo Queue is atm!,"I dont get why people are complaining about the quality of Solo Queue at all. Game has never felt more competitive, it doesnt matter if ur stomping ur lanes anymore, Riot has made sure that someone on your team will balance the game out for u!

And if everything is going a little to well, and you're looking for a bit of a challenge, just question mark spam whoever died stupidly, and hopefully you'll be able to make them question themselves enough to decide you deserve to lose after all!

Why would you play a competive game if u just want to load in and have easy 15-20 min victories, when you can have sweat inducing back and forth games that last for 40+ minutes with boths teams on soul point juggling the map, and hoping that the 6th man on Enemy team will do something more stupid than your own teammates to clutch that sweet victory!

Whelp. I'll be lucky to get any crystal ball points at this rate, cos I'm sucking hard hahaha xD Here's a few interesting data points :D

* 3+ Pentas is confirmed as the right answer so rip everything else D: There was only 2 pentas last year throughout all of Worlds, so clearly Pentas are made for Playins.
* Most kills in a game now has a floor of 9 to score. We'll have to see if that increases and to where.
* Still no Baron steals. Are we gonna go the entire Playins without 1? 
* There's some real low winrate champs atm. Ahri is 0/5 , Lee Sin is 1/4, Renekton is 2/8. There's a bunch that are 1/3 as well.
* Lastly, it's not Crystal Ball related, but Crownie joined Artemis with a nuts CS/M after 5 and 6 games respectively, with Crownie at 10.87 while Artemis is even better at 10.97.

i am just saying that talon have no legendary skin and he is 12 YEARS OLD (Kayn got 2) 😥

Talon has the same design SINCE 2011 and only 16 voice lines (not counting his grunts) and they are SUPER GENERIC and old and jhin has like 241 (just searched that)

talon made it today to 536 days with no skin...... we as talon mains hoped that he will be in the boy band BECUASE HE FITS MORE THAN K'SANTE AND SETT and it would have made him popular it really would have helped his pick rate

what about we forget about the boy band yone/sett/ezreal already got a skin this year not counting other champs like leona THAT GOT LIKE 4 SKINS IN 1 YEAR LAST YEAR but sure .. i am fine with 1 skin a year not 1 skin every 536 DAYS!! 😓

i am super frustrated that no one cares no one reply's by a confirmation that talon is atleast in mind no we are just being ignored and dunked but anyways

Talon's animation and GOD they are awful THEY ARE SOOO BAD look at his base skin like DAMN his auto's are soo bad AND HIS CRITS 🤮🤮 his cape just doing the *FEW* *FEW* animation every time he MOVES IS SOO BAD and his W looks like dull blades

hot,"Phreak on Seraphine changes: ""if this is neutral on winrate this is a midlane-skewed buff and an APC nerf."" ""More of her power will be in her solo lane,"" and W changes are ""the only real nerf to the kit.""","In his [most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spXs6ufs3Kk) Phreak explained his rationale behind the Seraphine changes and why they're not a death knell for Seraphine mains. I've transcribed some of the video and emphasized some key lines.

## Disparity between roles:
[38:18] 
&gt; [Mid and support] winrates are 0.1% apart—they are the exact same power level and despite having the exact same power level, support Seraphine pickrate is **sixteen times** midlane Seraphine pickrate.  

&gt; We can't really in good conscience buff a  53% winrate champion who's got a respectable pickrate, especially in high ELO where players optimize for winrate and thus pick a really, really high winrate AP champion. **I think bot lane carry Seraphine can be 51, 52%, that's fine.**

 [40:25] 
&gt; We decided to say ""okay, let's bring botlane Seraphine (who's way up here)...and support Seraphine is down here and let's bring their power levels together; let's have bot Seraphine and support Seraphine have roughly the same power level; that would be nice."" And as a side goal, if we can make Seraph midlaner better, that's nice, but it's also so incredibly unpopular: it has less that half the pickrate of *jungle Teemo*, for example—its pickrate is near-identical to that of Zyra jungle, and Zyra jungle is a 46% winrate jungler.

&gt; There's just not that much of a market for Seraphine mid, and so in terms of serving the sixteen times the number of players who clearly want to play Seraphine support and the 1/16th that number of players who don't play Seraphine mid, we say we're going to serve the sixteen times more players, and we have to compensate botlane.

[55:35] 
&gt; It's also worth noting that the entire suite of changes is *midlane* skewed; if this is in sum total neutral on winrate, this is a midlane-skewed buff and a botlane APC-skewed nerf.
&gt; ... if less of her power is in the absolutely absurd levels of healing from her W, this means more of her power is in her solo lane self-reliant power budget such as my shield is stronger/has a lower cooldown and my Q does more damage on a lower cooldown, so [the W changes are] midlane skewed, or rather a nerf to everything *but* midlane. Now, of course, teamfight output is of course weaker, to be fair; W2 is very clearly the best spell to echo. It's not even close; this skill is so overpowered, this is where basically all her power is.

&gt; **Our internal read on winrate magnitude is that this overall set of changes that we're still going through is about 0.5% winrate positive to botlane Seraphine and about 3% winrate positive to support Seraphine.** I'm a little skeptical, because I think [the W] nerf is very, very, very, very large, and I'm kind of relying on it to eat the entire power budget of everything else going on in this changelist because everything else is power-positive, and it's like, okay, this is the only line of a real nerf in the kit.

 [1:00:40] 
&gt; What's the overall result going to be for this champion? It's hard to say. **I think very strongly that support Seraphine is going to be quite a bit better; I think bot Seraphine will roughly tread water. I actually have reason to believe that mid Seraphine will gain winrate right here**; I think she will gain less than support Seraphine gains because the Q is so aggressively skewed towards support builds and not as aggressively good for AP builds, but there is definitely a chance that Seraphine is just busted next patch, and of course there also is the chance to get the numbers wrong and she sucks. And if she sucks, we buff the champion, but **the primary goal is to basically lower the gap between bot Seraphine and support Seraphine because we're not allowed to buff Seraphine in any role because bot Seraphine is too OP**. So we play up her level scaling, we play down her gold scaling, we play up her enchanter tendencies, we play down a little bit her group tendencies, and maybe we get to close the gap between botlane and mid and support, and that would be great because ti would be great to have her viable at all three roles.  
&gt; It's been a pipe dream so far; we've always been constrained by mid Seraphine being OP and support Seraphine sucked and then bot Seraphine's OP and support Seraphine sucked, and now it would be nice if we got all three. I'm not holding my breath, but that's the goal.

## Q changes:

 [47:11] 
&gt; Q is getting a shorter cooldown ranks one through four; it is getting more base damage ranks two through five and a better AP ratio at rank one, the same AP ratio at rank two, and a worse ratio rank three, four, and five. Now, remember what I said earlier about games ending on average with enough gold for three items.  
...Master Seraphine gets 6.5% less gold across their game than silver Seraphine botlane, which is to say it's much more likely that low elo Seraphine actually finishes three items than masters+ Seraphine finishes three items.  
...The rational thought is that Q is strictly stronger at rank one, strictly stronger at rank two, strictly stronger at rank three, strictly stronger at rank four, and then stronger at rank five from minutes nine through twenty-seven, until you finish Seraph's Embrace. **Do not let anyone tell you the Seraphine changes are a nerf because they are not, they pretty much can't be.** There is a part of time where the spell is weaker that is paid for by the first 25 minutes being stronger and that means that by her being stronger at winning 1v1s and getting lane priority and winning teamfights and securing objectives and killing turrets pays for more ability power to further offset where she would be weaker in a real game, the acute changes are a strict buff to Seraphine.  
...**Q is strictly buffed; it is more buffed for support than for a farm lane, but it is overall buffed for the champion, no ifs ands or buts. Q change is a strict buff to Seraphine. If this was the only change, she would gain winrate in every single role she plays. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise; they're wrong.**

## W changes:

[53:14] 
&gt; By having the shield go up per rank and the cooldown go down per rank and (though the rank one ability mana cost goes up) the mana cost per rank goes down, there are three levers here that all say maxing W is better than it was before. It's worth noting that, again, because support Seraphine does not get a lot of ability power, maxing Q is also better than before, so we'll see which way they go, but it is going to be a lot of power to support Seraphine in both of those cases. 
&gt; ...I'm believing pretty strongly we should never get anywhere close to Sona's level of cooldown. Spamming W on a short cooldown feels more like Sona's sort of thing and so leaving this a as a relatively long cooldown because it does shield your entire team and can be doublecasted for minimum 300 shield to your team *before* AP ratio—that's a lot of power, that's a way shorter cooldown, and actually more shielding than Karma E, so we have to be pretty respectful here. This can get way too powerful way too fast.
&gt; The final change to W as compensation is a pretty significant nerf to the heal of a repeat-cast W, so not only is the base heal going down by 2% missing health at all ranks, but also the AP ratio is going away entirely; there is no longer an AP ratio on the W.

## E changes:

 [59:16] 
&gt; The [E changes] are strictly midlane buffs; E cost per rank goes down from ten per rank to five per rank, and the E damage is [...] a meaningful damage increase at max rank: +60 max rank, so it's fifteen damage per rank up. So if you get to that lategame mid Seraphine scenario where you finally have more ability power, you finally finish the third item even though the game ended the moment you finish the third item, congratulations, E does more damage now and makes up for your damage in front of Q. So again, she's just a stronger mage than before. The up-to-60 extra damage on E (of course that is very late in the game and often not reached) but even the +15 at level 14 is easily reached [...] this is basically a freebie midlane lever to say ""hey, her level scaling is probably going to be a bit better now."" It's much harder for bot and support Seraphine to get the later levels.",HeirToGallifrey,1697643679.0,826,367,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17atrth/phreak_on_seraphine_changes_if_this_is_neutral_on/

Don't get me wrong, C9 tends to steamroll LCS, but out of 8 splits, we have seen 5 different champions!!! I'm sure LPL has had more but I really like how ""diverse"" our region is domestically!!!

I also really like some of the players like Spica and Dhokla, and for those that don't follow LCS too deeply on twitter, the community is really awesome. Though people are now afraid or too disappointed in the LCS to show their love anymore (valid reason), the community on twitter shows so much love to the players it's really wholesome there often.

I'm not saying that LCS will win worlds anytime soon, but I legitimately like our status at worlds. We are clearly not bottom of the barrel region, and at our best(which to be fair we don't show often lol) we can take down T1, like EG did in 2022!!!(I'm sure many people forgot)

Thanks for reading my post and I hope that NA can do well this worlds. Even if they bomb, I will coddle the teams and players as if they were my children.",crm1234567891,1697635662.0,956,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17aqsya/i_love_the_lcs/

hot,Finding Palafox's Genius in his KR Solo Queue Data (and why NRG beats Weibo tomorrow),"Hi, I'm Jack J! I work full-time on ""AI in competitive gaming"" and so have access to a lot of solo queue data. Today I decided to write an article for one simple purpose:

**Finding NRG Palafox's Genius in his KR Solo Queue Data**

Tomorrow (19th October 2023) the LCS Champions, NRG, face the LPL 4th seed, Weibo Gaming, in the first round of the League of Legends World Championship.

It’s far too easy to be an NA doomist, I mean, given their record and all. However, sometimes, all you need is a little hope. Today that hope has come in the form of an off-hand comment by XiaoHu, the Wiebo mid-laner, who described Palafox, his opposite number in NRG, as “powerful, and seems like a genius”.

Yes, this was later more accurately translated to be closer to “talented with potential”, but, as I say: today is all about spreading the hopium.

Now, I won’t be jumping immediately to “and so NRG will probably win Worlds”. Instead, I’m simply going to try and fuel the fire. My fuel, in this case, is a s##t tonne of Korean Solo Queue data, alongside a desire to answer a very simple question; what makes Palafox a genius?

Before we get into the detail, here’s a quick explanation of the data.

**Data Preliminaries**

* All data comes from **Korean Solo Queue**.
* A special thank you to [TrackingThePros](https://www.trackingthepros.com/) who provide me with the solo queue account names.
* I am writing this on the **18th October**, the data on the site below refreshes regularly and so will therefore not match exactly.
* Statistics are calculated from the players last **50 games**, to be best reflective of their current elo.
* All statistics are **adjusted by the players Champion pool**. They are therefore reflective of the player and how they perform above or below the average for their Champions.
* When quoting **percentiles**, they are being **compared** to all **Master+ accounts**, not just other professional players.
* **Kills/Deaths in the last 10 seconds of a game (fountain dives, mostly) are removed**, as to not punish regular for-fun fountain diving. Therefore, some games will not match **exactly** what is quoted in a player’s match history.
* You can see all data here: [iTero Korean Solo Queue Statistics](https://www.itero.gg/pro-statistics)

Now, on with the question. What makes Palafox a genius?

I have over 500 statistics to deal with, but to start let us keep it simple. He currently sits at a respectable 766LP, from an impressive 441 games. This puts him ahead of his lane opponent, but admittedly he’s had a few more games to get there.

[LP and Games in KR Solo Queue 2023](https://preview.redd.it/kbioqcd2dzub1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b101d5dbc73ae1c2532b2f714d91815cd3e06b6)

His Champion Pool is also, by most comparisons, fairly normal. No sign of his genius just yet.

[Palafox's recent Champion Pool](https://preview.redd.it/cabxdf7bdzub1.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31fc5403df56d8c13683200cc9fdea9e3156f5f3)

Having spent the last hour studying his Solo Queue data in an almost stalkerish level of detail, there was one theme that stood out among all others.

**Palafox is the KDA King.**

[ Overall KDA](https://preview.redd.it/i8ye5jfedzub1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55df5f6430152fb5acfda7159456689ca91b824f)

(Remember, all stats are adjusted by the Champion Pool. His “raw” average is lower, but he constantly over-performs on KDA when compared to other high ranked players who play similar Champions!)

There were several components that make-up his overall KDA that stood-out to me:

* KDA against his Lane Opponent
* KDA in the Jungle/River (and the impact on objective control)
* KD in Solo Bolos

## KDA against his Lane Opponent

[Kills + Assists on Mid-Laners](https://preview.redd.it/auej9nihdzub1.png?width=497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61249e5ec9295fa803452b40f3af9272e6780d0e)

Let’s start with his Kills + Assists against mid-laners. Although he’s in the bottom third of the elo (since solo queue mavericks tend to play riskier than pros), he remains competitive with more comparable opponents like G2 Caps and XiaoHu - Faker being an outlier for his passiveness in lane.

His genius, however, may best be seen when you use the above in conjunction with his Deaths to mid-laners.

[Deaths to Mid-Laners](https://preview.redd.it/090jpn5ldzub1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce29ff3f7663a7f73c2b3beda5e29093594882e0)

XiaoHu is killing mid-laners at a rate of 3.3 a game, but dying to them at the exact same rate, whilst Caps is even dying more than he kills them! Palafox manages to get 3.4 kills or assists a game on his fellow mid-laners, whilst only dying to them 2.3 times. A master class in controlled aggression.

**KDA in the Jungle &amp; River**

The second component is his KDA specifically whilst inside the jungle and river. Usually these happen during team fights and skirmishes around key objectives like Heralds and Dragons.

[KDA in the Jungle + River](https://preview.redd.it/054bdd0odzub1.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40776538c72759ba162891df05a5f565f57dc65c)

For this one, I use a slightly different statistic than normal. Rather than looking at a KDA Ratio, I instead add up all his Kills + Assists in the Jungle, and take away his Deaths.

The conclusion is really self-explanatory; Palafox seems to just be better than XiaoHu at team fights in the jungle. I really can’t be budged on this conclusion, sorry.

You may also be wondering; given his absolute dominance in jungle team fighting, do his teams tend to secure more Dragons and Heralds:

[Net Dragons &amp; Net Barons](https://preview.redd.it/6v0mohz0ezub1.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebd0612340b191ecd96759c23e2fa47c7c8b2443)

Again, I use a slightly different metric here. Rather than looking at the raw amount of Monsters killed, I look at the net value. If your team takes it, you get +1, if the enemy takes it you get -1, and if no one took it you get 0.

*Data Note: I include Dragons/Heralds that the player did not directly assist with, since there are plenty of ways of helping your team secure an objective without needing to be directly involved.*

With Palafox’s exceptional jungle team fighting he is able to help his team secure Dragons and Heralds far above the average, and certainly above XiaoHu!

**Solo-Bolo KD Differential**

As our final statistic, let us now look at how many Solo-Bolos he averages per game, and how that compares to his Solo-Bolo deaths.

[Solo Bolos KDs](https://preview.redd.it/7hktw6k3ezub1.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c3ae835a279ac1419b06be940a61af471b21c7)

If you look closely at the table, you can quite quickly see that NRG are going to beat Weibo tomorrow. At this point, it’s a mathematical fact. XiaoHu is only managing 1.39 Solo Kills a game but is getting Solo Killed 1.27 times? Our boy Palafox not only manages to get MORE Solo Kills (1.48), he’s also doing it whilst being Solo Killed considerably less (0.81)!

**To Conclude**

Through my research and writing of this brief Solo Queue analysis I have become increasingly confident that NRG will be beating Weibo tomorrow. This will come almost exclusively through an absolute monstrous mid-gap. Which will unfold a little like this:

* XiaoHu, in a desperate attempt to show his prowess will make a number of failed plays against Palafox, who will happily take the free Kill (or Assist), whilst safely farming his lane.
* Around the 8-10 minute mark, both teams will collapse around Herald where NRG will emerge victorious after an almost flawless team fight from their mid-laner.\*huffs the last tin of copium\*
* Although NRG are ahead at this point, it’s not until a monstrous Solo Bolo from Palafox onto XiaoHu and the subsequent Baron does the game become a complete one-sided stomp, followed by a 27-minute final push.

*All statistics in this article are true and factual as of 18th October, the additional commentary may contain traces of /s.*

hot,Fun Fact: JDG qualified to Worlds 80 days ago on patch 13.13. LPL Summer Split was shorter (69 days) than the waiting period,"While I generally like new Worlds format and enjoy it, it is embarrassing how awkwardly long we have to wait for the tournament this year, especially for regions like LPL. 

LPL Summer Split was started at **29th of May** on patch **13.10**, and on **30th of July** (*63 days from the start)* JDG were the first team to qualify to Worlds. On **5th of August** (*69 days*), LPL Grand Final had taken place on patch **13.13** and JDG confirmed 1st seed from China.

Tomorrow they will finally play at Worlds stage and it takes them ... **80 days** from qualification and **73 days** from Finals! More than the split was itself, we basically could have one more a complete LPL split in this window. Can't imagine how it feels for players to have such intense Spring Split, MSI and Summer playing 2-3 times per week with almost no pauses to then chill for basically 3 month to play at Worlds. All momentum is lost, and not to mention that Worlds is on patch **13.19** – **6 patches** (!) ahead of their last competitive experience together.

Interesting to see Ruler isn't no.1 for any of them after seeing that 80% of western analysts had Ruler as the best player in the world (often phrasing as its not close too). Also good to see Knight being 1st twice, and 2nd once after seeing many people putting knight as the 3rd best mid or as low as 5th 6th player overall.

I like this list cause it seems they are actually kinda actually basing it off performance this year (except the obvious doinb Crisp bias). Often when you ask pro players like the 10 best players, they either barely watch games from all major regions or they base it off scrims or who they like more (I'm looking at you Evi having apamen as a your top 5 top laner at Worlds).",katareky,1697634640.0,383,249,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17aqg9r/doinb_zoom_and_cn_caster_miles_worlds_top_10/

I think EN translations are delayed until next week but here are some highlights:

4:30 - DK players submitting Worlds pick'em

* Canyon: ""who will get the most penta kills... who did you guys pick?""
* Showmaker: ""I picked Deft, we have to give him a penta"" (Deft never got a penta in his entire LCK or Worlds career)
* Deft: ""wow if I get a penta at Worlds...""
* Canyon: ""But I picked Ruler...""
* Showmaker: ""Ah sh-...."" (to Deft) ""He said he picked Ruler, really? We could even run into JDG...!""
* Deft: ""OK well I'm voting for Kanavi now!""

5:40 - question is ""did you ever think there was a chance you would not qualify for Worlds?""

* Deft: ""When Summer Split ended we were in a really worrying situation, but Playoffs scrims went really well so after that I felt like we would make Worlds 100%""
* Kellin: ""Yeah we overcame a lot of issues during playoffs and now **Worlds scrims are also going super well**""
* Deft: ""I feel like we got a lot ""closer"" during in game comms later in the season. IRL we were always pretty friendly from the start but it took some time to get that same closeness in game, for example if a teammate makes a mistake, they aren't so worried now about how other teammates might react in game""

8:25 - excerpts of in game comms during scrims

* Kellin: ""Canna don't worry, bot lane is over, we're good""
* Showmaker: ""\[Canna\] if you can just group and be a warm body we can win""
* Canna: ""I'm not sure if I can even do that lol""
* Showmaker: ""Yes you can LOL... our top wave state does make me want to quit the game though""
* (I think eventually enemy team FF'ed the scrim)

18:18 - question is ""how is the team spirit now?""

* Showmaker: ""After Regional Finals the team morale has been really good. I would say, Worlds is a really fun experience - compared to LCK there's a lot more nerves and a lot more at stake. We've all been to Worlds before, and in order to reproduce \[for Canyon/Deft/SM\] that amazing feeling when you win Worlds, everyone is giving extra effort and I think that's contributing to the team spirit.""
* Canna: ""I think our team synergy has improved a lot, like we're better at matching each other's picks and creating a cohesive team comp now""
* Canyon: ""We've been playing together for like 8 months now, so I think our teamwork is really good at this point""
* Deft: ""I also feel like our drafts are a lot cleaner now than they were in early season""

21:36 -

* Interviewer: ""So Worlds is the last time the 5 of you will be playing together...""
* Showmaker: ""Ye-- but we could still play together next year...! The last time...? Well it's true, I've been at DK for my whole career but I don't know what will happen next year. It could even be my last Worlds, who knows \[he said this lightly don't take it too seriously...!\] All of my teammates, coaching staff, front office staff and everyone else are really good people, and I really want to do well at worlds to pay them back for their constant support""

24:55 - not sure what the question was

* Showmaker: ""I do watch foreign leagues - mostly LPL + LEC. Those leagues have a lot more fights, like when my teammates and I are watching we'll go 'what? they're really going for \*this\* fight?'

25:30 - is there a player or team you're looking forward to seeing at worlds?

* Deft: ""There's this player named Canyon - he tells me jungle feels stronger than previous patches and I think he's an exceptionally good player so I'm looking forward to see what he can do this Worlds. In terms of teams, JDG won MSI, and they also have players who performed well at Asian Games, so I'm looking forward to seeing them.""
* Showmaker: ""At Worlds, the player I'm looking forward to watching is **myself**.""
* Kellin: ""I want to play against JDG Ruler. I don't think I've ever won against him so I want to win this time around.""

30:00 - Showmaker the comedian

* Interviewer: ""What is the name of this documentary again?""
* Showmaker: ""It's ""Be the One"" right?""
* Interviewer: ""No it's ""We are One...""""

teams take the two 3-0 slots and the three 3-1 slots and qualify. We'll give Western teams a bit of a break and let GAM get knocked out 0-3 or 1-3 along with four Western teams. This leaves
three Western and three Eastern teams at 2-2. If any Western teams draw each other (about 60%) one is guaranteed top 8. In the other case, East vs West, East vs West and East vs West, some of the best Western teams at the tournament get three opportunities to
beat some of the weaker Eastern teams at the tournament. We'll be pessimistic and say each Western team only has  around a 15% chance of winning their bo3 at 2-2 against the Eastern team. That's still  ~40% (1-0.85^3) for any Western team to win their match-up.

hot,Nofe’s Worlds 2023 Swiss Stage Meta Predictions,"Just something to read before Worlds 2023 swiss stage starts. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fen_ihkqdPA) 

Nofe was a former league coach, and is currently an LCK caster. This is a quick review of the 2023 Worlds Play-ins meta, alongside a prediction of how the meta will shift during the Swiss stage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Translation**

As always, I’m going to focus on drafts and meta instead of hyperfocusing on individual teams. So my goal is to guess the swiss stage meta by taking a look at what worked well in playins.  

If you look at how metas shifted during various stages of previous Worlds, there is a very obvious trend.  Obviously, play-in teams have a much lower level of play - and this is reflected in their drafts. These teams tend to draft with a focus on teamfights. In the later stages of the tournament, the stronger teams are much more lane focused. And this isn’t just a matter of preference. In the play-in stage, teamfight–focused comps tend to have a much higher winrate.  

This pattern held in this years playins. Despite all the speculation about how the Worlds patch would play out, the play-in stage meta was all about teamfighting. That being said, the meta will probably change drastically once the swiss stage begins. Just like how previous metas shifted drastically during the group stage. The best Asian teams are very good at snowballing off of lane advantages, which is the reason why lower tier teams have such a hard time pulling off upsets. Anyways, the swiss stage meta will probably be completely different from the playin stage meta, and my predictions are attempting to account for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TOP** 

 Keeping that in mind, let’s take a look at which champions had priority during playins. Starting with top. There were 2 picks that stood out – K'sante and Renekton. Renekton’s MR nerfs compounded with the statikk shiv nerfs made it look like split pushers like GP, Gnar and Gwen would dominate the meta, but these champions didn’t manage to make it onto the stage. Defying expectations, K’sante and Renekton held strong. When teams were forced to blind pick top, most teams chose to pick Renekton. These teamfight powerhouses were popular, especially among weaker teams. Interestingly, K’sante fared very well in the head to head against Renekton. Renekton’s greatest strengths are his lane priority into his strong Herald fights, but K’sante neutralized these advantages very well. Rumble and Kennen were also strong picks into Renekton, especially when paired with Jayce Mid. I believe this AP top / Jayce mid pattern will carry on into the Swiss stage. If you look at the results, K’sante did much better than Renekton. Renekton was much weaker than previous patches, especially against AP tops. Oh, and Adam’s GODS were definitely interesting to watch. I’m not sure how well these picks will work out in the swiss stage against the strong asian top laners. They all play mean Gnars, and there’s also a slight chance that some Asian tops will counter with Fiora, reminiscent of former Worlds. Since this is a meta where junglers actually go top, it will be interesting to see how the Asian teams interpret GODS. 

So, what do I expect to see during the swiss stage? To begin with, I predict a lot of Kennens and Gnars. And maybe Gangplank depending on the player. I don’t want to get too deep into this, since it’ll take a long time to explain, but the top pool depends on the mid pool. With the popularity of Syndra and Orianna, ‘standing mages’ that have a hard time side laning, top lane champions with strong side laning abilites will naturally become much better. Champions like Jax. These champions and their lane counters will become much more prominent in the Swiss stage.

&amp;#x200B;

**JG** 

 Moving on to Jungle. If you look at solo queue statistics, Lee Sin, Nidalee and Jarvan look very powerful. But so far, this trend didn’t make it’s way into pro play. Maokai dominated. Of course, there’s a chance that this is due to the fact that playin teams prefer teamfighting champs. Taliyah was also a high priority pick. I thought about the JG picks for a very long time, and I’ve arrived at a conclusion. Which jungles will be meta? I’m sorry to say this, but I expect Maokai and Sejuani to be the most contested jungles. Syndra, Orianna, and Azir are going to me the mid meta champs - no question about that. These champions need a strong dependable frontline. Will top play this role? No. Jax and Gnar are going to be splitpushing. Which leads to the natural conclusion – we’re going to see tank jungles like Sejuani and Maokai. I expect lots of Maokai, Sejuani, Jarvan, and Vi. Maybe Nocturne to aid the splitpushing top, or even some Viegos. In other words, the champs we’ve seen all summer, with the addition of Jarvan. With Lee Sin, I’m not sure. Despite currently performing well in solo queue and scrims, Lee generally tends to do poorly on stage. Some LCK teams like T1 and DK who love snowballing might take the risk, and LPL teams like BLG might try as well. Lee Sin works well with Sylas Galio and Lissandra, which are all champions that Yagao excels at. 

 Oh, and slightly unrelated, but there has to be an LCK or LPL team that plays Taliyah all the time in scrims. The playin teams drafted heavily around Taliyah, especially BDS. Teams seem to place rate Taliyah very highly, which personally didn’t make much sense looking in from the outside. Taliyah does have swap value though, so some LCK and LPL teams might bust her out on stage.  

&amp;#x200B;

**MID** 

 Next, on to mid. Despite all of the nerfs, Azir is still a strong meta pick. With a strong skill set, good late game value and playmaking ability, Azir simply refuses to leave the pro meta. The skill set is one that pro players refuse to give up. Azir is just too good at parrying kill threats from champs like Rakan and Jarvan. And Azir’s late game value is strong too, melting tanks and poking. The champion is too perfect. Yone and Akali match well into Azir though, so expect to see a few of those. The Asian mids are all great at Yone and Akali. Their mere existence prevents blind pick Azir, which I expect to limit Azir’s impact on the meta post swiss stage.  

 This patch, Orianna and Syndra are insane. If you look at the data, both champs have high presence, and Syndra’s win rate is off the charts. Since stronger teams tend to put higher priority on laning, these champions will become even more important as time progresses. Expect to see more of these two, not less. I expect that all of you know about Showmaker’s Syndra, or Faker’s infamous Orianna shockwave. No matter who you look at, be it Bdd, Knight, Yagao, etc., all of the Korean/Chinese mid laners are extremely proficient at playing Orianna and Syndra. Not a single player is bad on these champs – maybe Xiaohu? But even Xiaohu was once famous for his mid mages. There are no weak players. Neeko is also a strong playmaking pick alongside ADCs like Kaisa, and I expect to see some Neekos, but her laning is not quite as strong as it once was. It really depends on the team and the players. Sylas/Akali/Yone will be utilized by teams focused on midgame, especially teams that prefer strong mid carries like Gen G and DK. There is a good chance that we see these champs. Sylas may have a hard time laning against AP mid mages, but he does have an advantage against team comps with powerful ults. Maokai, Sejuani, Gnar and GP all have strong ults, furthering the case for Sylas. Last but not least, Leblanc could see some minor play paired with Lee Sin. All in all, the mid meta is interesting because there are so many champions that could see fringe play. Even Galio and Lissandra could see some play. Tristana and Annie are not as strong anymore, I would prefer Jayce over Tristana.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bot** 

When you build a team comp, the choice of ADC is the most important thing to consider. The entire team composition is warped around the choice of ADC. In that sense, there are 2 champions that have very distinct flavors – Xayah and Kaisa. If your team has Xayah, the goal is to make the other team come into you. You want 2 things - a sturdy front line and long range. Xayah comps go hand in hand with mid mages and with long range mids. Azir, Jayce, Tristana. Force the enemy to engage, and let Xayah clean up. 

Kaisa is the polar opposite of Xayah. The entire teamfight revolves around how well you can focus fire a single priority target when Kaisa ults in. Kaisa loves champions like Yone, Ahri, and Neeko. Not that Kaisa can’t be used with, say Orianna, but if you want to make the most use out of Kaisa’s DPS, you need to draft a dive comp. 

 Ezreal, Aphelios and Zeri made their mark during playins. Looking at solo queue data, the best ADCs were champs like Ezreal, Ashe, Kalista and Jhin. All supportive ADCs, without a single hypercarry. The ADC carry meta was nonexistant. But in play-ins, the meta did a 180 and shifted towards hypercarry ADCs. But it’s impossible to tell how the meta will shift during the swiss stage. LCK and LPL teams can take a bot lane advantage and snowball the entire game off of that, so we could see a lot of Ezreal Karma, Kalista + @, Caitlyn + @, etc. If teams can manage to annihilate Kaisas and Xayahs during the laning phase, the ADC tier list can change drastically. So it’s really hard to predict what will be strong until we actualy see what happens on stage. And since ADCs are the backbone of team comps, drafts will be completely different depending on what ends up on top. 

 If it turns out that supportive ADCs like Ashe and Jhin are dominant, then teams will start playing around mid game comps. In this case, they’re going to have to find late game value somewhere else – which will probably result in a surge in popularity of powerful splitpushing top laners. So the Top meta depends on the ADC tier list. It’ll be fun to see what ends up on top. No one knows what’s going to be good. But if there’s one thing I’m certain of, it’s that utility supports are really *really* weak compared to previous seasons. So we’ll be seeing lots Nautilus, Rakan and Rell. This points towards Kalista being strong and Ezreal/Caitlyn being weak, but it’s hard to tell. Sivir isn’t bad, and teams with skilled support players might play Senna, since Senna funnels gold into supports. But I think that Kalista will be the staple meta ADC. If initiation supports are meta, then Kalista will be used to both compliment them and to have a strong laning phase. Kalista is good at transfering bot lane dominace into the upper half of the map. And she pairs off with mid mages very well. And people have this perception that Kalista is complete crap late game, but she’s stronger than you’d think, even though she doesn't compare to actual hypercarry ADCs. 

I could be totally wrong, and the meta could shift to something I couldn’t have dreamed of in a million years. Just take this as my personal take. The meta will change from swiss to knock out to Finals, so it’s really impossible to tell at this point. To summarize my personal opinion,  

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary** 

Predictions before play-ins: Supportive ADC’s like Ashe and Jhin will be meta, Top &amp; JG will play carry picks, mid mages will be strong. 

&amp;#x200B;

The playin meta: ADC hypercarry meta, and junglers mostly played tanks. Mid mages were strong.  

&amp;#x200B;

Swiss stage predictions: We will have a Top &amp; Jungle Carry meta, with a few ADC hypercarry comps sprinkled in depending on the team. Teams will try to snowball through bot and roll the snowball up to top. And in the process, the high priority champions will be strong side laners like Gnar, Gwen, Jax and bot snowball champs like Kalista. Some ADCs might play hypercarry ADCs like Xayah and Kaisa. Azir, Syndra, and Orianna will be strong picks in the midlane.

Hi! I'm Yoon. Just wanted to post a quick(or maybe not so quick?) meta prediction before the swiss stage starts. Nofe usually has the best draft analysis among various public League analysts, so I wanted to share his take on the meta.

I wanted to know how the percentages would have changed after the first day draws. (It is still at 62.4% for at least one team to get out of groups without even beating a Eastern Team when simulated for 10,000 times). While talking to a few of my friends on discord yesterday and analyzing on how the swiss stage could shape up as the tournament goes, I decided to build a simple app here:

[https://worlds2023simulator.vercel.app/](https://worlds2023simulator.vercel.app/)

Its a free deployed build and quite rushed. It started off as a simple console script that I probably shouldn't have made into a web-app but here we are. Please ignore any defects and it surely could have had more features but for now it has two modes to play.

1. Randomize Results:
   1. Randomize (East Biased): In this mode the next round is generated but East always wins vs West and G2 always wins vs West.
   2. Randomize (Completely Random): Complete Chaos
2. PickEm': At any round, you are free to click and select on the outcomes for matches and ""LOCK IN"" after you select your picks.

I searched for what the [rules](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Archive:Official_Rulebooks/Riot/Worlds/2023) would be for teams to draw into matches in the following Rounds but saw that there are no additional rules so it is supposedly random?

hot,Prayers for T1,"For T1

Hi everyone,

I don't normally make these posts, but just wanted to share how I feel about the upcoming Worlds 2023 as a long time T1 fan.

I've watched T1 play since their 2013 debut, and have cheered the team on ever since. I've been heavily invested in the ups and downs of the team, and for the past 2 years it's been rough. 

The current T1 roster for some reason makes me so emotionally invested... Despite their potential, they've fell short from earning any international titles.

That being said, watching the individual videos of T1 players expectations and thoughts on the upcoming championship truly makes me sad... it really does feel like regardless of the outcome, we will see a change to this roster.

All in all, I truly wish the best for this team and I will send them my energy for every game of this tournament. I know they can be the protagonist for this tournament and truly represent what Deft has sad about unbreakable will.

hot,13.21 Full Patch Preview,"""Full Preview: 

**Jungle Followup**: Jungle followup isn't listed here, but we plan on returning the AD ratio to the pet and adjusting some of the healing values. Our short term plans are to get the within role balance back so the different classes (and the champions within them) are each viable again. 

**Bel'Veth**: We're trying to buff E a bit, especially now that it's worse at early ranks without further encouraging a few points Q -&gt; E max. 

**Hecarim**: Hec was disproportionately hit by the blue pet changes, we're adding some baseAD back to get him more onto Sheen builds rather than lethality

**K'Sante**: Lots of bugfixes for K'Sante, increasing damage in all out form and lowering cast time on Q with HP purchases

**Le'Blanc**: Buffs to W as her bread and butter spell and E as the spell that has more gameplay

**Aurelion Sol**: Taking some amount of damage out of tap Q's and moving more towards the burst Q's in addition to moving some damage out of level scaling and into rank scaling

**Briar**: We're a bit of power out of her statcheck (she should still be good at it), while retaining lane Briar being reasonably powerful

**Cait**: Discussed Cait yesterday, but we think Lethality Cait shouldn't be her most powerful build

**Jinx**: This change should allow Jinx's passive to still result in those ""unleashed moments"", while capping some of the high end cases that seem a bit much

**Rammus**: Taking his damage down a bunch through both W converting to resists and early Q damage. With the pet resist synergies, this should also reduce clear time by some amount

**Brand/Zyra**: Some small adjustments to get a few more mages and AP's into the jungle, not trying to displace their main roles

**Seraphine**: Through their pickrate, Seraphine players have expressed their desire to play her in the support position. This doesn't mean that we're making mid/bot seraphine dead, but trying to narrow the gap between them. 

**Hullbreaker**: We opted to pure nerf Hullbreaker, as it is degrading some side lane patterns a bit much; needing to buy Hullbreaker to match another Hullbreaker is not a particularly desirable pattern"" - https://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1714457786405548502

hot,Why not embrace bot lane APCs?,"I frequently see people sad about certain mages being pushed out of mid lane because of how the game of League has evolved. Makes me wonder why we don’t see more bot lane APCs? I think, at this point, Seraphine and Swain prove that it’s perfectly fine to do. You don’t really need an ADC for objectives anymore since everyone deals so much damage and every role has champions with good single target or attack speed scaling. Why not take more mages into the bot lane role? Mages usually scale pretty nicely so why not put them in a place where they have a babysitter that can help them scale and a (usually) squishy and immobile ADC to play around.

hot,I need your advise on how to shut my friend up about his constant whining over the collector.,"Challenger of the rift! Heed my call!

Every single game I hear the same stupid, loud mimimi about how the item ""the collector"" should be removed and how bullsht this item is according to my ""friend"".

""sooo broken""! he whines.

He keep saying ""it just kills me without an attack!"" and never stops the dumb babbling.

And when I leave our discord call, he starts writing in /all and /team, speaking to himself in anger.

I am getting mentally ill.

I just can't do this anymore.

I refuse to play with him at this point.


Please, I need tips to make him stop.

Anything, really.

Consensus:  Solo and duo recalls from Wild Rift were not ported, emotes still use corrupted FX, abilities still use corrupted FX, more and brighter wings in ult to match Wild Rift and Xayah, splash art and icon should be mirrored, recall bug, clipping issue... i.e. the skin is not of legendary variant quality and is not the [promised port](https://youtu.be/ghr26eNTiz0?feature=shared&amp;t=313).

hot,Correction: Post bracket draw (Getting through the Worlds Swiss Stage without ever beating LPL/LCK),"In the last post, I accidently used the wrong version of the code; I really should stop naming these things COPIUM\_1\_1\_1. I was watching the Divephoria episode and pretty much had an 'oh shit' moment when I realized. I apologize for putting out incorrect information; that post has been deleted and I am posting this because I don't like bad information floating around because of me, so sorry again for multiple posts. 

After the round one bracket draw there is a  **63.6 % chance** that at least one Western team makes it out of the Swiss stage without ever beating an Eastern team. The chance for two teams is **\~.07%.** The very small hopium chance of three is gone. 

After looking more deeply at potential first round draws, the 'bad' first round draw ends up not being too bad, because after this round we're getting a round of East vs. East and West vs. West matchups. Round two draws end up not mattering as much for the same reason. The biggest swings in probability were in Round 3 and onward draws.

hot,"Genuine Question, why is everyone not honor level 5?","look, I wont lie to myself, the honor level 5 rewords are hot booty cheeks. but all you have to do is play the game and not call people slurs. is it really that hard to just competitive bs and say ""damn, you're playing master yi, clearly you're ass at the game"" or something along those nature.  


I know league is probably one of the most toxic communities out there but, as someone who competitive bs's a lot, Honor level 5 is not that hard to get. Infact, I think its the easiest part about this game.   


I've been playing this game for about 3 years now and usually get honor level 5 within a few months of the reset because I don't understand peoples desire to tell everyone to ""keep themselves safe"" or call them racial or derogatory slurs. its a video game. 

what prompted me to ask this is because my friend recently just posted in my discord that he managed to reach honor level 0. and while I would be surprised, I know the man and I'm not surprised. but I've seen people here and twitter saying getting honor level 5 is too hard for what its worth. I promise you, its not. unless there's some secret about honor level I don't know about that's holding people back.

hot,About riot's username changes,"Basically, riot is swapping from unique summoner names specific to league of legends to usernames, with a TAG, across all of their games. Meaning that while in league of legends, you used to have a username different from valorant, a unique one too, lets say MafiaQiQi, now your username will look like MafiaQiQi#EUW1 across every riot games' title.

Following this main change, riot has announced the following adjustments:

* Name changes cannot be purchased with blue essence anymore. They will be purchased using the relevant of $10 in-game currency. With a free name change every year.
* Names will be global across all riot games.

I personally believe this change is actually terrible and shouldn't happen due to the following reasons

* You no longer have the feeling of unique identity belonging to you, if you thought of a unique funny username that you feel proud of, everyone else may use it, even in the same server.
* Your gaming identity is supposed to be a picture of how you would describe yourself in a fiction world. By forcing users to select a TAG, you are limiting the way they can express themselves.
* The fact that changing it in less than a year costs $10, following the samira overpriced skin, the dark cosmic erasure jhin skin, and some may say the redeemed star guardian xayah &amp; rakan shows that riot has been getting greedy, minimal work for tons of profit, and while yes this is how companies are supposed to work, riot for as long as I remember hasnt been this way, I felt like they showed a feeling of caring about players, making affordable skins for as low as 400rp, now, while we still have access to epic skins, it is shown that the newest of their choices, specifically those that I said above, show a feeling of greedyness, at least the way I see it.
* Adding to the above, I feel like it should be mentioned that this year, riot invested the biggest budget compared to other years on league of legends.
* Blue essence will be completely useless for people that have unlocked every champion, except for essence emporiums(by the time a new champion comes out, those players would have plenty of BE to buy the champion like 9 times).

Some argue, that this is indeed a good change because

* 2 or more people would be able to use the same username

This is true but this doesnt promote unique identities in the game world. Instead you are gonna see the same usernames on 30% of the games. Furthermore, if someone mains zeri in league and puts a username like IamLightning, or he just puts a funny username like AlwaysDyingCarry he is gonna be forced to have the same username on valorant and other riot titles, where the community there is likely to not get the joke. Furthermore, seeing funny unique usernames, gives me a smile most of the time, however, seeing, AlwaysDyingCarry username every 9 games makes the joke no longer funny.

Judging by the comments on their twitter post, the majority of the community by far HATES this change and I can see myself why. However I wondered what reddit would think of this, id appreciate if you could all state your opinion and reasoning below, and I would be happy to read through most of the comments. Thank you if you decide to engage in the discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments, I have read most of them. I was originally planning to respond to every single one. However I really cant do so, there are over 900 comments soon to be 1k I never expected it to be this much. Your views have given me insights both on how yall see your own username and on how yall perceive the game's direction in the future.

Some points id like to address include the following, I will probably keep editing the post with more updates based on what I read.

Many people are saying that this is not a ""serious"" change and the game is free2play etc. Yep, I agree with that, I will still keep playing the game after these name changes, this post isnt a rant of some sort, I simply felt like sharing my opinion and asking on how others perceive this change.

""If you care about your identity in a game, you would not be changing it every X months"" - While this may be true, there are still people who just like changing their ign, including me? I have used many joke usernames including AlwaysDyingCarry, H\*ntaiSenpai, MafiaQiQi, ParentsLost5050, Ceo of RACISM, CEO of Oxygen and many others that I feel like will at least make a few % of players laugh. Changing it, gives me that feeling of being different and also I make my friends laugh with them when we queue up. It also gives me a reason to grind for blue essence while also giving a chance to another player to use them too.

""Uniqueness doesnt matter its just a game LUL, games and identity? no lul"" -  [According to some research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/brain-trust/201512/online-games-show-player-personality-and-how-change-it), your username and how you choose to play in an online world can hint at your personality and by compiling millions and millions of these data points, the researchers point out that they can guess at ""psychological traits across global populations."" This is just the first result that came up from a google search, if someone dedicades more time, I am pretty sure he can find up more about this. There are of course other factors in someone choosing a username. However, it is still YOUR identity it is HOW you see yourself and want to be seen by fellow players. It is something you chose other people to see you for.

""I dont care lol imagine caring about usernames"" - This is a post made so that I, the OP can get a better understanding of what the community thinks about this change, if you have nothing to contribute to the discussion, then simply stay quiet lol, sometimes silence is just the better option. I never once mentioned that this is a GAME CHANGING change, or that this will destroy league, or anything along those lines, I as mentioned above, will still keep playing the game even if this change goes through.",PROManosWAR,1697536589.0,2658,1195,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179uqky/about_riots_username_changes/

hot,"For fun and memory's sake, here's a trivia quiz on the funniest bugs out of old Mordekaiser's 350+ bug count","Hey everyone! 

Mordekaiser's rework has now been here for about 4.5 years (crazy, huh), and I wanted to make a fun little thing for everyone to smile and laugh a bit about the wonders this champion brought us before his rework. 

For the people who wouldn't know because it's been a long while now, pre-rework Mordekaiser was, by a very long shot, the buggiest character in League's history, with [over 350 bugs found](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8fcwr7/and_to_conclude_the_streak_with_over_300_book/), [enough to make a book out of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaHJlgsDYa4). 

Some of them were irrelevant, and lots of them were impactful but boring. But some of his bugs were downright hilarious, and so I want to make people recall or discover these beautiful creations. 

So here's a trivia quiz on some of Mordekaiser's best bugs! 

&amp;nbsp;

**1) What gameplay difference did Mordekaiser’s skins use to make in 2016?**

- A) They gave his ghosts a chance to turn invisible. 

- B) They gave dragon pets a leash range. 

- C) They made his VFX visible through fog of war. 

- D) They doubled his shield generation. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!B) They gave dragon pets a leash range.  
Unlike the other big summons, Mordekaiser's dragon didn't have a leash range and wasn't intended to have one. Mordekaiser could be bot lane while his dragon was mid. Except that for the first year of juggernaut Mordekaiser's existence - all the way up until we found the explanation - his dragon had no leash range with the basic skin, and had one if he wore any other skin (the dragon would blink back to him if he'd go further than ~2000 units away from him). [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2zsY072Gz4)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**2) What happened when Mordekaiser killed Ekko after ulting him?** 

- A) Ekko's ghost ulted the blue team's fountain before warping back to where he died. 

- B) Ekko's ghost had permanently increased range and each of his attacks made him dash to his target. 

- C) Ekko's ghost spawned on the blue team's fountain and instantly died if Mordekaiser was on the red team. 

- D) Ekko's ultimate was replaced with Mordekaiser's for the remainder of the game. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!A) Ekko's ghost ulted the blue team's fountain before warping back to where he died.  
Dealing full damage and all (counted as Mordekaiser's). [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ucNmbm65w4)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**3) What happened when Sylas attempted to use Mordekaiser’s ultimate on a target entering a bush?**

- A) The target immediately died and respawned without a death timer. 

- B) Mordekaiser gained control of the resulting ghost instead of Sylas. 

- C) Sylas transformed into Mordekaiser until his death. 

- D) Sylas lost the ability to use his keystone until the end of the game. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!C) Sylas transformed into Mordekaiser until his death.  
When ulting, Sylas takes the shape of the champion he uses the ult of during the cast. But with Mordekaiser’s ult, if the spell got canceled (by losing vision on the target), he would just… not transform back, until his death. [Thread with a video and everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/MordekaiserMains/comments/ambxji/explaining_the_sylas_transforming_into/)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**4) Runes affecting shields have a history of not working correctly for Mordekaiser. By how much did Revitalize increase his shield generation, at most?**

- A) 0%

- B) 16.5%

- C) 110%

- D) 1005%

**Correct answer:** &gt;!D) 1005%  
For years, Revitalize didn’t work properly on Mordekaiser’s shield generation (gain 5% HSP, heals and shields you cast or receive are 10% stronger on targets below 40% HP). Then someday, it got “fixed”. Except that instead of increasing his shield by 5% and 10%, it went on to increase it by 5% + 1000%. Here’s what his [passive](https://prnt.sc/lkmaz0) and [E](https://prnt.sc/lkmgno) looked like with it.!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**5) What happened when Pulsefire Ezreal killed an enemy affected by Mordekaiser’s ultimate?**

- A) No ghost was created. 

- B) A ghost was created, but its basic attacks were permanently replaced with targeted Mystic Shots. 

- C) A ghost was created, but it was permanently invisible and impossible to click on. 

- D) A ghost was created, but it was permanently invisible and stuck in place. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!C) A ghost was created, but it was permanently invisible and impossible to click on.  
In most cases, Mordekaiser’s ghosts took the shape and most properties that the champion had upon dying. A champion turning into a ghost while in an invisible state would, in several cases, make the ghost fully invisible. And Pulsefire Ezreal disintegrates the enemies he kills. [Video](https://youtu.be/zfM4oT4cftg?t=590)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**6) What could Mordekaiser NOT do for his opponents?** 

- A) Give an enemy a heal of 1500+ hitpoints with his W. 

- B) Give the opposing team the Baron buff. 

- C) Give the enemies his location through fog of war. 

- D) Give the other team bonus AP with his ultimate. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!D) Give the other team bonus AP with his ultimate.  
A) An enemy Braum could eat Mordekaiser’s heal and take it for himself (and that heal could go in the 1500-range). [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCpoY2c3Hsw)  
B) No video of that one, but if you’d attack Baron with the ghost of a Darius, have the ghost die, and then have Baron die from the bleed, it’d be given to Darius’ team and not to yours.  
C) Mordekaiser’s W detonation could be heard through fog of war. If you’d put your camera over where an enemy Mordekaiser was and he’d use his W, you’d be able to hear it even without vision. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbK6FGUzyE).!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**7) A Jhin ghost could have some advantages compared to the real Jhin. Which one of these options could a Jhin ghost NOT have?**

- A) Every attack firing the 4th shot. 

- B) 2.5 attack speed. 

- C) Attack range permanently increased to 700. 

- D) Critical hits dealing 200/225% damage at all levels. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!D) Critical hits dealing 200/225% damage at all levels.  
A) Probably Mordekaiser’s most famous interaction – Jhin’s ghost would never use ammunition, and as such would remain on whatever bullet he died with. So killing a Jhin with his fourth shot ready would result in the ghost firing his fourth shot on every basic attack. [Video](https://youtu.be/x4oi_OroBPI?t=25)  
B) Jhin’s ghost also had unlocked attack speed. So he could reach upwards of 2.5 AS. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR4yZO0npI0)  
C) Ghosts could gain Energized charges, but they couldn’t trigger Statikk/RFC’s empowered attacks. That meant that they would never *lose* the charges, and that RFC’s increased range would apply to every attack once charged.  
D) That one is *almost* applicable too. Jhin’s crits deal reduced damage compared to other champions’, but for some reason, a Jhin ghost would only get that damage reduction after level 16 – crits before that dealt full damage. D ends up being the correct answer because of “at all levels”.  
[And here’s a display of a fearsome Jhin ghost.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9f4lG9S6wA)!&lt;  

&amp;nbsp;

**8) What could happen when you activated the Guardian Angel of an opponent affected by Mordekaiser’s ultimate?**

- A) Your ultimate was replaced with Mordekaiser’s for the remainder of the game. 

- B) Your abilities stopped functioning until the ghost died. 

- C) Every player crashed and the game disappeared. 

- D) The opponent’s Guardian Angel was automatically sold the moment it was activated. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!A) Your ultimate was replaced with Mordekaiser’s for the remainder of the game.  
There's an explanation, but just take the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tATL2XjVMbQ).!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**9) What could using Protobelt cause for Mordekaiser?**

- A) Make Mordekaiser’s ghosts release the Protobelt projectiles on every basic attack for the rest of the game. 

- B) Make Mordekaiser’s W invisible for the rest of the game. 

- C) Prevent Mordekaiser’s E from dealing damage. 

- D) Disable the opponents’ Press the Attack keystone. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!B) Make Mordekaiser’s W invisible for the rest of the game.  
Using Protobelt with W active would make the effects of the spell disappear from that point on, for all players who had their screen on Mordekaiser the moment he used the item (on either team). [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfHWIrWQvXk)!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**10) What happened when Mordekaiser used his ultimate to kill an enemy Mordekaiser’s ghost?**

- A) The champion killed gained the ability to create a dragon ghost. 

- B) The ghost refreshed and came back with full health and a full timer under the control of the enemy Mordekaiser, but lost its items. 

- C) Mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed, and until his next death, his shield would fully refill whenever it got depleted. 

- D) Mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed, but with a permanent +100% attack speed and bonus movement speed. 

**Correct answer:** &gt;!D) Mordekaiser gained a ghost of the champion killed, but with a permanent +100% attack speed and bonus movement speed.  
This was a bug that I found really late despite playing a lot of blind pick. I guess you just… never think of wasting your ult on a ghost. I have no idea how that happened, but the ghost of a ghost had some properties of a dragon ghost – Mordekaiser’s ult icon was replaced with the one he got from controlling the dragon, the ghost gained bonus movespeed towards Morde (like the dragon’s), it had bonus attack speed, and it didn’t gain the bonus AD and HP that a champion ghost would get from Mordekaiser’s stats. This couldn’t be chained – that ghost would not give a ghost from being ulted by Mordekaiser. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR4yZO0npI0)!&lt;

I joined the raffle every day since the start of play-ins, so those are 7 entries. Some days only a couple thousand people joined the raffle, so I figured my chances of winning one were pretty high. Unfortunately I did not win anything.

As the title says I am curious if anyone actually won a Mercedes Hextech chest in the daily raffle. And if anyone won one, what did you get out of the chest? I wonder if they are any different compared to normal Hextech or Masterwork chests. They look pretty neat at least.

&amp;nbsp;

# see previous changes:
 * [2023 October 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/176fi2g/pbe_datamine_2023_october_12_patch_1321/):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;adjustments to Seraphine, buffs to Tahm, some new ARAM balancing, and Ivern Nexus Blitz easter egg

 * [2023 October 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179gf15/pbe_datamine_2023_october_16_patch_1321_more/):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;more changes to Seraphine, as well as Brand and Zyra

&amp;nbsp;

# changes since then:

##### Smite:
 * jungle pet damage per attack:
     * base value:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16.0 --&gt; 15.5
     * bAD scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0% --&gt; 10% (revert of 13.20 change)
     * AP scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10% --&gt; 12% (revert of 13.20 change)
     * other scalings for 3% bHP and 20% bAR/bMR are still using their post-13.20 values
 * jungle pet healing per attack:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;70% of damage dealt --&gt; 13-46 lerp 1-12
     * previously this healing was capped to 12-45 lerp 1-12, to account for the new tank scalings, but this is probably redundant now that the healing scales independently, although the calc for the cap got updated to the new 13-46 values regardless
 * the 12% missing health healing from large monsters now appears to be capped to 90 healing (requiring 750+ missing health)

##### Aurelion Sol:
 * Q damage per second:
     * scaling from spell rank:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15-55 --&gt; 45-105
     * scaling from level:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30-80 lerp --&gt; removed
     * scaling from AP:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;60% --&gt; 55%
 * Q burst damage:
     * scaling from spell rank:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40-80 --&gt; 60-100
     * scaling from level:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20-30 lerp --&gt; removed
     * scaling from AP:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35% (unchanged)
     * scaling from target tHP:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3.1%% of Stardust stacks (unchanged)

##### Brand:
 * stats:
     * health:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;590 +102&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;--&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;570 +105
     * armor:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 +4.7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;--&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27 +4.2
 * P monster dot damage modifier:
     * live:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x1.2
     * old:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x3.6
     * new:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x3.0
     * reminders:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;monster dot damage cap is still unchanged at 80 pre-mitigation per tick, and the aoe pop damage is not affected by monster modifiers besides dealing x0.5 to epics
 * previous changes to attack speed and E base damage are still in

##### Briar:
 * attack speed growth:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.3% --&gt; 2.0%
 * P remaining bleed value healed on kill:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;100% --&gt; 125%
 * W2 missing health bAD scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4%% --&gt; 3.5%%

##### Caitlyn:
 * P crit chance scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;81.25% --&gt; 85%
     * this formula is pretty complicated, crit chance and crit damage become additional tAD scalings, which gives the following results:
     * base tAD scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;60% / 90% / 120% @ 1 / 7 / 13 (unchanged)
     * additional tAD scaling from crit chance (**no iedge**):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;142.1875% --&gt; 148.75%
         * example:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;at level 13+ with 0% crit chance, then she doesn't gain anything extra and just has 120% tAD scaling, if she had 50% crit chance at level 13+ then she'd now have a 120% +(148.75% * 0.5) = 194.375% tAD scaling, and at 100% crit it'd now be 268.75% tAD scaling
     * additional tAD scaling from crit chance (**with iedge**):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;178.75% --&gt; 187.00%
         * her crit chance scaling also stacks multiplicatively with crit damage
 * R:
     * base damage:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;300-750 --&gt; 300-700
     * bAD scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;200% --&gt; 170%
     * crit scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35% --&gt; 50%
         * reminder:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;damage is increased by up to this amount at up to 100% crit chance
     * cooldown:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;90s-60s --&gt; 90s constant

##### Hecarim:
 * AD growth:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3.2 --&gt; 3.7
 * W duration:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4s --&gt; 5s

##### K'Sante:
 * P mark R true damage conversion:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35% constant --&gt; 45% / 60% / 75% @ 6 / 11 / 16
     * technically this means you will still gain benefit even if you don't upgrade your ult at those later ranks, but it might be easier to implement it this way to keep all the data for this effect on the passive instead of splitting some of it off onto the ult
 * Q cast time buffs from earlier are still in
 * W min charge duration:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0.65s --&gt; 0.75s (revert to live)
     * this was mistakenly claimed to be 0.65s on live when it was actually set to 0.75s, yesterday it was actually set to 0.65s, now it's back to 0.75s
     * this does not affect the RW variant which is unchanged from live at 0.5s
 * W max charge duration:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.0s --&gt; 1.5s
     * this also applies to the RW variant

##### LeBlanc:
 * W damage AP scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;65% --&gt; 75%
     * RW damage unchanged at 75%
 * E2 damage AP scaling:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;70% --&gt; 80%
     * E1 damage unchanged at 35%
     * RE also unchanged at 40% then 80%

##### Morgana:
 * W base damage per 0.5s:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6-26 --&gt; 6-28
     * total over 5s:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;60-260 --&gt; 60-280
     * reminder:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;damage is amped by up to x2.7 at 100% missing health, but you can't really deal the max damage over the entire duration outside of really specific situations so the math here becomes complicated
 * W monster modifier:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x1.65 --&gt; x1.70

##### Rammus:
 * Q base damage:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;100-200 --&gt; 80-200
 * W bonus armor:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35 +40%-80% tAR&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;--&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30 +35%-75% tAR
     * magic resist unchanged at 10 +30%-50% tMR

##### Seraphine (changes since last time):
 * Q main missile speed:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1400 --&gt; 1200 (revert to live)
 * all other previous changes still in place

##### Varus:
 * W onhit base damage:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7-27 --&gt; 7-31
 * E slow:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;25%-45% --&gt; 30%-50%",FrankTheBoxMonster,1697576096.0,139,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17a8g40/pbe_datamine_2023_october_17_patch_1321_nerfs_to/

hot,champion fantasy,"players who are browsing Reddit are engaged more than rest of the player base same with watching YouTube or twitter, I don't know if you remember but sometimes there are justifications for some changes to a champion like Olaf with ult change a while back, many more with most recent being Jinx, those changes are made to not buff the champions power in particular but to make their fantasy stronger for the player, so I wonder why are some champions allowed on the rift while others are stuck in the basement. take for example Jinx, her power fantasy for most players would be her aoe rockets and crazy speed from passive, Jinx being a pro issue in the past, zeri power fantasy for most zeri players would be her aoe and speed steroid from ult, zeri being pro issue too, both are similar in their fantasy but with different conditions, Jinx needing to score takedown, while zeri has to stay in combat otherwise she runs out of juice, so how come one champion is praised to the sky being arguably broken right now and the other had her knee caps broken with a sledgehammer",Diskuter,1697669292.0,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b3qkv/champion_fantasy/
hot,My experience as a lee sin one trick in aram.,"Ah, another day dawns, and what better way to spend it than indulging in my ARAM addiction, featuring my beloved Lee Sin.

I graciously rise from my 29-ARAM-marathon-induced slumber at the highly productive hour of 2 am. With immense enthusiasm, I shout to the heavens, ""ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TRIUMPH IN THE PRESTIGIOUS ARAM MODE OF LEAGUE OF LEGENDS!""

As I click the ""League of Legends"" icon, I'm greeted by an enigmatic app called ""Riot Client"" – it dares to demand my ""username"" and ""password."" Curiosity piqued, I decide to create a fresh account of the day. Behold, ""LeEsinsblind"" is born, and it tells me I've successfully signed up in OCE, a realm I have absolutely no clue about! Riot Games, the masterminds behind League of Legends, must've recognized my true potential and granted me this unheard-of rank!

I dive into a brisk warm-up ARAM, and what do you know, Lee Sin graces me with his presence. To clarify for the less enlightened among you, Lee Sin is a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-everything champion. His hidden passive? Rendering me blind as a bat, and not due to any moonshine incident, mind you.

His Q ability is an auto-targeted missile that homes in on the nearest ADC, whether in this game or the next, revealing their location and providing me with vital information like their credit score and their mother's relationship status. If I'm not satisfied with their financial health, a quick Q-press sends them packing, wiping their League account and transferring their gold to my offshore bank account.

My W ability involves dashing to an ""Ally"" and shielding them, but let's be real; shields are overrated when you've already started the game with four Death Dances and can heal from true damage. No big deal.

My E, well, it marks the area around Lee Sin, essentially functioning as an AoE nuke. Unfortunately, it only obliterates nearby champions and provides a meager 300 in-game currency. Such a pittance, I know.

And now, Lee Sin's pièce de résistance, his ultimate, R. Trying to explain it to mere mortals is a task reserved for the elite minds of at least Bronze 4. I'll demonstrate its incredible power in due course.

As the game begins, the enemy team quakes in terror at the mere sight of me, Lee Sin, who shows no mercy. I order them to line up in front of their nexus, as their towers and inhibitors have wisely sworn allegiance to my cause. Their feeble cries fall on deaf ears as I meticulously pass judgment with my Q, one by one.

But this becomes tiresome; I'm already drained from the monumental effort of queuing up. So, I hit that E button, instantly obliterating all players and granting me a handsome stack of gold to purchase my one and only necessary item: Duskblade of Draktharr. I even Venmo some random Ornn player to upgrade it to Draktharr's Shadowcarver because, let's face it, I'm too busy being awesome.

The enemy team attempts to surrender, realizing their futility against my unparalleled might, but I, the benevolent Lee Sin, reject their pleas as I eagerly await the airdrop of my new item.

At last, I decide it's time to claim my rightful victory. I casually stroll up to the enemy Rammus, who's rocking a cool 971 armor, and press my ultimate at him. Together, we watch in awe as he rockets towards his own nexus, shattering their base, and presumably, his monitor along with it.

The victory screen warmly welcomes me, and with the profound humility only Lee Sin can muster, I queue up for another exhilarating All Random All Mid. Because really, why waste time on anything else?",ereface,1697669224.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b3po5/my_experience_as_a_lee_sin_one_trick_in_aram/

hot,Why do you think our playerbase is so disrespectful?,"Title, basically.  
I've been playing since season 7 and it's always been toxic, let's not pretend otherwise, but we used to have banter, funny exchanges and overall respectful interactions. Trolls will be trolls, but the average player would generally act like a real person even when losing. Nowadays i only see the worst of the worst in players (the ones who still communicate at all, anyway). If i start off with a ""good morning"" or ""glhf"" i get answered with slurs and mean wishes, and if i get outplayed and compliment my opponent i receive a ""stfu you're so trash"" to the face. There's just no respect for ourselves and each other anymore.

All in all i just want to know people's thoughts on why that is. Have we just pushed away anyone ""normal"" and this is what's left? Is the game's design that makes us behave like this? Have we all just slowly get turned into goblins? Interested to see what people think

hot,Why are we not using cool features from other (Riot) games into League ?,"In the past few weeks me and a few friends been dabbling into some other games, and came into our attention on why games like League Wild Rift and Dota 2, have features like:   


* More in depth player/champion stats
* Pre-game item purchase
* Character/skin 3d model visualization
* Map/rift customization
* Better player profile customization
* Custom announcer packs

But PC League has a lackluster version of these or not even even that.   


Wild Rift that is made by Riot, has really cool looking animated and interactive champion 3d models that you can examine, but this is non existent on PC League. Dota 2 customization of your game is miles ahead of league, with custom VO for announcers (rn during the international they have several announcer packs from casters, and community members from different regions to purchase), map skins, UI skins, custom profile layouts, and so on. And the amount of stats data that you can access in Dota 2 is immense in comparison.  


I'm aware that league has way more pressing issues with its service/client that need to be addressed first (for example, it's been almost 800 days and the BR server still has account transfers blocked). But my question is:   


With the large amount of funding that Riot has, enough to fund multiple games (Wild Rift, Legends of Runeterra, TFT, League Stories Games, Project L, League MMO, etc), Hollywood level production of shows (Arcane, Arcane Season 2), Musical productions with several famous artists (Lil Nas X, New Jeans, Twice, G-Idle, Imagine Dragons, etc), then why? When it comes to its main core game, they seem to not add new features (its taken multiple years for them to allow us to choose a different language of the client in League, this is coming in November), QoL and customization stuff that Riot themselves implemented to its other games under the same IP?

A little background on my situation: I’m a multi-account master tier ADC main looking to give something back to the community that I grew up with through solo queue coaching.

I sometimes review vods of my friends/mutuals to help others improve, and overall I have a very strong sense of macro knowledge in my particular role.

hot,Why the Swiss Format is the West's true hope this Worlds! I ran the numbers.,"I've never seen the Swiss format before, so I decided to create a Python script to simulate it. I ran this simulation millions of times, collecting data for analysis. What I've found is quite interesting.

A common narrative I’m hearing about Swiss from people who’ve seen it in other esports is that “if there’s an upset things will get weird.”  

While it’s true, it’s also missing something big: **The Swiss stage does not need upsets to get weird.**

To prove this point I want to rank the teams, and to remove my own bias we can use the outright betting odds from multiple sites and take the averages. This is what it looks like.



| Rank | Region | Team | Outright Win Odds |
|------|--------|------|--------------|
| 1    | LPL    | JDG  | 1.445        |
| 2    | LCK    | Gen.G | 4.389        |
| 3    | LPL    | LNG  | 5.515        |
| 4    | LCK    | T1   | 7.53         |
| 5    | LPL    | WBG  | 9.083        |
| 6    | LPL    | BLG  | 9.333        |
| 7    | LCK    | KT   | 12.41        |
| 8    | LCK    | DK   | 14.5         |
| 9    | LEC    | G2   | 40.553       |
| 10   | LEC    | FNC  | 78.333       |
| 11   | LEC    | MAD  | 88.667       |
| 12   | LCS    | C9   | 98.333       |
| 13   | LCS    | NRG  | 177.777      |
| 14   | LCS    | TL   | 252.777      |
| 15   | LEC    | BDS  | 275          |
| 16   | VCS    | GAM  | 444.444      |

Thankfully region distribution works out neatly, the top 8 teams are from the LCK and LPL, and there’s a bit of a gulf between DK (rank 8) and G2 (rank 9).

Let’s define an upset as any rank 9-16 team beating a rank 1 to 8 team, which is the same as saying an upset is an LEC/LCS/VCS team beating a LCK/LPL team.

I ran the simulation while setting the chance of upsets to 0%, and gave regions win rates. Here’s a chart of it.

| Region 1 | Region 2 | Region 1 WR(%) |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| LCK      | LCK      | 50%             |
| LCK      | LPL      | 50%             |
| LCK      | LCS      | 100%            |
| LCK      | LEC      | 100%            |
| LCK      | VCS      | 100%            |
| LPL      | LPL      | 50%             |
| LPL      | LCS      | 100%            |
| LPL      | LEC      | 100%            |
| LPL      | VCS      | 100%            |
| LCS      | LCS      | 50%             |
| LCS      | LEC      | 50%             |
| LCS      | VCS      | 50%             |
| LEC      | LEC      | 50%             |
| LEC      | VCS      | 50%             |
| VCS      | VCS      | 50%             |
| VCS      | PI       | 50%             |


To summarise the chart, if a 1 to 8th ranked team is playing a 9 to 16th ranked team, they have a 100% win rate, every other matchup is a 50% win rate. 

Now this is where things get juicy.

I ran the simulation 100k times and these are the results.

| Teams Advancing | Non-LCK/LPL |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 0               | 37814       |
| 1               | 60756       |
| 2               | 1429        |
| 3               | 1           |
| 4               | 0           |


**Without ever beating an LCK or LPL team, 1 or more LEC/LCS/VCS teams advance in 62% of simulations.**

The real clever ones reading this probably have also realised that for this to be true, LPL/LCK teams will be going home without ever losing to anyone but LPL/LCK teams.

Pretty cool for the west right? Bare in mind these stats above are an absolute minimum as clearly the Western teams will have a better win rate against LPL/LCK teams than 0%... surely.

If we compare Swiss with the old Groups format using the same seeding pools, you’ll see how much better this format is for us. 

With the old format, using the same win-rate method as above, not a single LEC/LCS/VCS team will ever advance to quarters. This is because each group will have an LCK team and an LPL team and they will get 4 wins plus, meanwhile this means the other 2 teams lose 4 each at a minimum.

Due to the increased randomness of Swiss over the old Groups stage, and to the detriment of getting the true best 8 teams into the finals, the west is definitely happy here. Should we feel bad that it’s very likely an LCK / LPL team will drop out of the tournament by losing only to LCK / LPL teams? Probably, but hey it will be nice to win for once.

I have more data using dummy team by team win rates, trying to simulate closer to what will happen. I got to these win rates by working backwards from the outright winning odds, and trial and error with win rates until the output matched the outright. Perhaps I’ll go in depth of it, that’s for another post though. Here are some interesting things I learned, bare in mind the accuracy relies on the quality of the input, and it’s impossible to know the true odds before teams play.

1) In Swiss the average rank difference between teams in games is smaller than Groups, by approximately 1.1. Meaning we get more competitive matches. Groups has far more completely one sided matchups.

2) Over 72% of scenarios had 2 or more LEC/LCS/VCS teams advancing

3)  Only 1.3% of scenarios had 0 LEC/LCS/VCS teams advancing, so 98.7% had at least 1.",PandoranHuman,1697656948.0,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17ayyrq/why_the_swiss_format_is_the_wests_true_hope_this/

hot,The Stats we don't see,"Hi all,

So I'm writing this in the hopes Riot will consider implementing so additional information regarding how effective items are. Currently most items show how much additional healing, shielding, damage etc they are giving, and in some cases (Spirit Visage, Eclipse, Divine Sunderer) we can see multiple types of benefits.

Currently there are a few missing that I think would be good to see, most notably the new adc mythics are all lacking information as to their additional damage output.

Infinity Edge additional Crit damage

Navori Quickblades additional Crit damage and cd reduction

Bloodthirster additional damage and healing done

Collector number of executes and gold

Lord Dominics additional damage through % pen 

Voidstaff through additional %pen

Rylais Crystal Scepter time slowed (sec)

Cosmic Drive movement speed active (sec)

Riftmaker healing done

Shieldbow healing done

Blade of the Ruined King healing done

Ravenous Hydra healing done

Mortal Reminder damage from % pen

Guinsoos Rageblade on hit damage done, additional on hit damage done (for other items producing off this) and additional damage done from %pen

Serylda's Grudge additional damage from %pen and time slowed (sec)

Divine Sunderer additional damage from %pen

Plated Steel caps damage reduced from auto attacks

Eclipse additional damage from %pen

Runaans Hurricane additional damage from on hit damage and additional damage from on hit damage from other items

I feel adding these would give players a lot more clarity on what their items are actually doing ingame as the many already showing these details do.

I would also suggest adding additional damage from flat pen items like Sorcerer boots and Lethality items.

I'm interested if others would like to see this information. Let me know your thoughts.

hot,Some possible champion changes,"**Kayn:**

\-  Kayn already has an indicator for his E but it shows only either his full duration length or the reduced length. While there is already an audio cue thats played when his E runs out due to not being in a wall, I think a visual clarification via an indicator could also help.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I think similarly an Out-of-Champion-Combat-Indicator could help so that you aren't suprised when you directly exit the wall . Maybe for this and the previous point there could also be an elegant solution which I don't see.

&amp;#x200B;

\- On the vision of E: I feel lt is unintuitive for enemies, that he just has a vision radius around him when inside a wall and can thus see over other walls he isn't inside off. I don't think you can see his shadowball inside the wall through FoW, so the enemies don't know that he sees them. Either walls could proberly block vision or the enemies could be notified wth eyes over their head.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  Expanding on the point of vision in E, it can be confusing for Kayn himself to understand that he doesn't get vision in bushes during E (same for Zoe Ult).  Normaly bushes you don't have vision of throw a shadow onto themselfes. However since for Kayn/Zoe during E/R bushes don't throw a shadow it looks as if you have vision inside, even though you don't.  I understand that at least for kayn, if bushes would throw shadows his vision inside some walls would get severely nerfed,  but one could also try to implement that the bushes don't apear as bright.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rammus/Nunu:**

\- It would be great if you could cast Predator while using powerball/biggest snowball ever! without canceling the effect

\- same for the ARAM summoner spell mark

&amp;#x200B;

**Aphelios:**

\- make E castable while dead, so that I can think about gun rotations while dead. And maybe add the weapon symbol to the notification so that its quicker to see. Additionally let it display offhand amunition while dead (or maybe let us cast w while dead instead? idk)

\- release an legendary/ultimate skin where aphelios talks instead of alune (money hack$$$)

&amp;#x200B;

**Janna:**

\- let Janna use E during her R channel

&amp;#x200B;

**Jayce:**

\- make his melee E less buggy. Knockback away from Jayce in the correct direction.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hecarim:**

\- give him one emote, where he does a pesade/levade while neighing. Could even do it at the start of his E?

&amp;#x200B;

The following points might be more controversal and I'm not sure if I want them changed myself, they are just ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fiddlesticks:**

\- remove the unintended R-W-F combo

**Jarvan IV:**

\- adjust his manacosts, so that he is not completly troll in lane.

**Senna:**

\- max her range at 100 souls. Still gain additional AD from further souls.

**Zilean:**

\- just remove the clunky passive and give only him passively bonus exp

All you need to do is add the bot using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1033373984110166036&amp;permissions=311385131008&amp;scope=bot%20applications.commands), then in any channel use the /subscribe command to receive live game announcements. You can subscribe to LEC, LCS and of course Worlds.

You can see the upcoming schedule too, as well as the current standings, and even customise the timezone to your server so the schedule is in the correct timezone. Currently the game starts are announced using the schedule on the LoL eSports website, but soon it will be updated to detect game starts, but for the Swiss stage and it being BO1, the schedule will still be largely accurate.

Why threads? The bot originally was just for me and my friends, as we wanted to hide spoilers from those who didn't wish to see, and not spam the main channel, so I decided to make a bot to make threads, and it works super well.

hot,"LPL fans, how do you stay so confident about the region?","Okay trust me the title doesn't say the full picture of my thoughts. I'm a LPL fan, and I do think LPL should be the slight favorites for this Worlds because of this insane JDG team, and great LPL summer split. But I think I'm unlike other LPL fans, that I'm not confident about the overall LPL showing at all. And this is because of the swiss stage. A LPL team implodes in Worlds every single goddamn year, and I'm honestly getting a bit traumatized by it. Feels like ever since 2020, every LPL team gets rated highly coming into Worlds but 1 or 2 teams shit the bed in group stage, while LCK gets every team in quarters. I'm tired of this expectation just to feel depressed in group, this year swiss stage so I'm fully expecting WBG and one of BLG/LNG to not make it at this point. If they all do, I'll be very pleasantly surprised and happy but I'm not expecting it. 

But once LPL reaches the knockout stage, I'm very confident in them. I thought that EDG could genuinely win vs DK when they were huge underdogs, I thought RNG were as good as T1, when the 18-0 T1 roster was considered by fans to be the greatest roster ever.

The crazy thing is that I think LPL has a much higher chance of winning worlds than actually getting all 4 teams into knockout stage. The scrims rumor so far support this happening again as well. I'm not one of those ppl who think scrims don't matter, well its fair if you do. But the current scrim rumor is that the best scrim teams are all LCK teams and JDG+G2. All LCK teams and the chinese 1st seed in semis has happened for the last 2 years, albeit due to different reasons such as CN vs CN in quarters and FPX drama but it doesn't inspire confidence.

So, LPL fans how do you stay so confident? I need some of that copium, I think western fans were the ones that needed copium but I need some rn. I'll not be happy if its the JDG and LCK show, and JDG wins worlds.",katareky,1697639776.0,4,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17asbh8/lpl_fans_how_do_you_stay_so_confident_about_the/

hot,MAD Hylissong reflects on grinding SoloQ,"# 1.)Getting flamed in SoloQ:

*Interviewer:* 

You have a special playstyle and like to limit test a lot. Do you ever get flamed or inted by your team in SoloQ?

*Hylissong:*

Oh yeah, it happens a lot. You have teammates, who go play like 50 games a day, then they're just burned out. They feel like I am inting, but they don't say it, because they are chat restricted, right? So they bait ping me instead.

They don't feel like I am doing anything right and I don't feel like they want to play with me or something so I just roam and make plays happen.And it turns into a vicious cycle.

""This cycle is very exhausting and not productive.""

&amp;#x200B;

# 2.)Dealing with toxicity:

*Interviewer:*

Do you ever flame back or how do you deal with this kind of toxicity?

*Hylissong:*

I usually mute and ignore them. Sometimes I'll add them and I'll tell them something, and they react the wrong way. But that's on me because I didn't choose the right moment, especially if they were emotional post-game,but it's completely understandable and normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 3.) Difference between Pro and Non-pro schedule:

*Interviewer:* 

When you became a pro, how did your schedule change?

*Hylissong:*

When I became pro there was a planned schedule on what I should be doing throughout the day: when I am playing solo queue, when I am having fun, when I am going for dinner, when I am having gym, and when I am having review — all these things planned. 

It's not spamming games all day long, and then you feel like crap going to bed and then the next day is exactly the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 4.)Benefit of a pro schedule:

*Interviewer:*

Do you see any benefits following the schedule?

*Hylissang:*

I would say so. After one bad thing goes wrong, it's not like, ""Oh my god..."" My mental is very stable, strong, and I'm also good mechanically right now. I can say that's because of the things I now do before the day starts, the more balanced schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5.) SoloQ advice for beginners

*Interviewer:*

Do you have any advice for people, who can't get out of elo hell?

*Hylissong:*

Play champions you personally like — kind of your pocket picks, so that's probably it. And yeah, also try not to dwell on negative thoughts during the game. Instead, be more about having fun and reviewing things if they go south, not just ignoring them. So, just focus on having a good time and not ending the day hating yourself or your teammates. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Interviewer:* 

Thank you for the interview!

hot,Easy Tweak Champs for Jungle,"As 13.20 and now 13.21 patches have shown with the changes to Morgana, Zyra, and Brand, Riot is trying to broaden the number of champs who are jungle viable, even nerfing other parts of their kit slightly after the buffs required for jungle.

I think that there is some low-hanging fruit that Riot is missing out on, and I was wondering what others people had. Champions who could jungle with minor tweaks, feel different to play than current junglers, and would be healthy for the game as a whole.

Cho'gath: All he needs is an increase in his monster cap on his E. At rank 1 the 3% max health damage caps at a measly 60 damage - which even slows down his first clear as the level 1 buffs have 2.3k health (without the cap he'd do 9 more damage per E - 27 more damage per cast) while the caps are really designed to prevent champs from taking down objectives too quick. While Cho's ult is great during smite fights, the more common tank build is actually really bad at taking down objectives quickly. (Most of his damage comes from ult &amp; % health on his E)

A change on his cap from 60+20/rank to maybe 100+20/stack would speed up his first couple clears to be semi-competitive (still on the slow side) and average at objectives. Nothing else in his kit would need to change.

I think Cho'gath jungle would be healthy for the game since while he has 3 CCs and an execute, his lack of gap-closers (or any movement) keeps him from being too annoying to play against when 2/3 of his CCs and his execute are close-range and the third is telegraphed. (Unlike if Lissandra was made a viable jungler as Phreak mentioned.)

hot,Quick play taking over blind pick vs fill players,"I might be a niche part of the player base but hear me out. 

Let me start with I'm part of the sad regions that do not have normal draft. So If quick play straight up removes blind pick I will not have a ranked option on summoners rift apart from quick play. 

Im one of those players who plays fill in normals and likes to match my champ to my team comp. (I play most roles equally as badly so it doesn't really matter ) however quick play taking over blind pick seems quite worrying for me. The whole shtick of my friend group is we are all fill players and depending on the mood we all swap out our roles and champs or play with knowledge of what our new guest friend is picking. 

 Quick play may remove this from my friend group. And we usually play as a group of 3 and 4 so playing ranked flex isn't a consistent thing to do. (I can play soloq when playing alone )

A large part of elden ring content online (if you're not into PvP and I'm def not into elden ring PvP lol) is challenge runs with weird builds. Some of my favourite YouTubers are LilAggy and Bushy if you want an example of what I'm talking about. When I saw their content I really enjoyed it despite me not liking offmeta stuff in league and I think it's because elden ring is PvE. 

Imo the biggest problem with playing offmeta in league is that it's a team game and there's always someone who won't be ok with you playing suboptimally because they want to win in the more standard way instead of whatever whacky shenanigans your pick gets up to. If you're playing something like idk shack support and your adc has never played with a shaco before the lane is gonna be unnecessarily hard right? 

This is why I think League needs a good PvE mode like Odyssey in 2018. It's explicitly for fun and maybe you can even grind it for rewards but the important thing is that it's playing against an AI so if you decide to go ap graves or something it's no big deal. 

Urf kinda used to be like this before everyone figured out that ADCs were the best role even in urf (wow shocker adc is op who could have seen this coming) but even that was playing against other people. I think we can all agree that being the weird off meta pick in urf and being ahead and cheesing everyone is very fun but being the victim of the offmeta pick and being cheesed makes you want to break your monitor. 

What do you guys think? Would you want an Odyssey style PvE mode? I feel like it would be really good for the game.",Vanilla_Breeze,1697661904.0,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b0vjq/league_needs_a_good_pve_mode/

hot,Varus Q Change," I just played my first Varus game of the patch so I didn't notice sooner that they snuck in change for Varus' Q indicator that was not mentioned in the patch notes. Together with the range indicator there is now also a projectile indicator. Normally I don't really mind those kinds of changes but this indicator is really really distracting to me because you have to channel the spell and it's there for the full duration. Like I said things like this normally don't bother me but this is quite a bad ""QoL"" change in my opinion. It doesn't look that bad in the picture but when you play the champ it just feels so off and distracting. Maybe there is a chance they revert it, if not this is actually a thing that sadly would make me not want to play Varus.

hot,Singed Rework Concept," Goals of this concept:

1. Highlight his Identity of a twisted doctor with tons of body-horror
2. Keep Q and E, change the rest
3. make him use his shield properly

&amp;#x200B;

**Passive**  
**Careful Observation**

**INNATE:** Singed's basic attacks are empowered to deal 5-81 (Level 1-18) (+ 30% AP) bonus magic damage and causes him to enter Observation against the target for 5 seconds.

This effect cannot occur on the same target once every 30 / 25 / 20 (Levels 1/7/13) seconds (affected by ability haste).

**OBSERVATION:** Singed raises his shield in the target enemy's direction, gaining 10-40% (Level 1-18) (+ 1% per 300 bonus Health) (+ 1% per 100 bonus armor) (+ 1% per 100 bonus magic resistance) damage reduction in that direction.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q**  
**Poison Trail**

Static Cooldown: 1 | Cost: 10 Mana per Second

**PASSIVE:** While Poison Trail is toggled off, Singed gains 2 / 3.5 / 5 / 6.5 / 8% bonus armor and magic resistance and 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15 bonus health regeneration.

**TOGGLE:** Singed gains 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 12% bonus movement speed and continually creates a toxic cloud in his wake that lingers for 3.25 seconds. The cloud inflicts Poison to enemies within, and resets the duration every 0.5 seconds while they remain.

**POISON:** The target takes 4 / 7 / 10 / 13 / 16 (+ 10% AP) magic damage every 0.25 seconds, slows them by 20% and grounds them over 2 seconds. Subsequent inflictions refresh the duration.

&amp;#x200B;

**W**  
**Injection from Afar**

Static Cooldown: 2 | Cost: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 Mana

**ACTIVE:** Singed shoots a syringe in the target direction which stops at the first enemy hit, dealing 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100 (+ 45% AP) magic damage and stunning them for 1 second.

Singed gains a Charge of Injection from Afar every 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 seconds, up to a maximum of 2 Charges.

&amp;#x200B;

**E**  
**Fling**

Cooldown: 10 / 9.5 / 9 / 8.5 / 8 | Cost: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Mana

**ACTIVE:** Singed flings the target enemy 550 units over himself, dealing 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 (+ 60% AP) (+ 7 / 7.5 / 8 / 8.5 / 9% of the target's maximum Health) magic damage, capped against minions and monsters.

After the cast time, he enters Observation against the flung target for 5 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

**R**  
**The Host**

Cooldown: 160 / 140 / 120 | Cost: 100 Mana

**PASSIVE:** Enemy champions damaged by Singed are marked for 4 seconds.

**ACTIVE:** Singed pulls all marked targets in the center relative to their position and merges them into one unit called Experiment for 4 seconds.

The Experiment has 345 movement speed and it's health consists of 100% of all merged target's current health. The Experiment is disarmed and grounded. All merged champions can cast abilities and put in the location where the unit should go, although the Experiment will go to the (hierarchically) first location.

Singed and his allies can damage the Experiment, where 40 / 50 / 60% of all post-mitigation damage dealt to this unit will also be dealt to all merged enemies at the end of the duration. If the Experiment dies, all merged champions also die.",SpringBossLP,1697659706.0,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b01eq/singed_rework_concept/
hot,Patch 13.21 Preview,"[Riot Phroxzon tweeted:](https://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1714095781815390266)

&gt; Overall: Our early indications of how 13.20 has landed have been pretty positive! Players have been appreciating the slower paced games, better fight pacing and reduced snowball out of the early game. Game time is up about a minute and back to where it was in ~Season 7-8. Snowballing is around the lowest level it has been in around 5 years.
&gt; 
&gt; Jungle: Jungle changes have landed reasonably well overall. We think this helps reward junglers who are more efficient and we've been happy with seeing some of the initial movement on the balance of ganking and farming (Smite changes moved a lot here)
&gt; 
&gt; However, the within-role champion balance is off. Some tanks are too strong and a lot of AD champions are too weak.
&gt; 
&gt; We're looking to return the AD ratio to the pet damage and do some more changes to the healing (to move some more back to flat values)
&gt; 
&gt; The jury is still out on whether the power of the role is in the right spot and we'll continue to monitor over the next few days for whatever followup adjustments are needed.
&gt; 
&gt; K'Sante: K'Sante shows some initial promising skew movement being better for average players and worse for Pros. We're fixing a bunch of the bugs that have shown up, buffing him up a bit and we're continuing to monitor the feedback here.
&gt; 
&gt; Rammus: He's just too strong with his heavy synergies with the resist buffs on the pet. Taking him down some.
&gt; 
&gt; Kha'Zix, Bel'Veth, Hecarim, Master Yi: These 4 junglers were disproportionately hurt by some of the changes; a mix of objective value going down AD ratio removal from the pet, Blue pet nerf for Hec. Bel'Veth had additional movement from a set of direct changes. Looking to bring each up by some amount in addition to reverting the pet AD ratio nerf.
&gt; 
&gt; Other Junglers: Tank junglers have moved up quite a bit, which is unsurprising. They'll go back down by some amount after the pet AD ratio is restored and we'll continue to monitor them after this.
&gt; 
&gt; Le'Blanc: After the whole Shiv saga is over and done with, she's landed quite a lot weaker, so we're buffing her back up
&gt; 
&gt; Aurelion Sol: Scaling champions as a whole are a bunch stronger this patch and ASol is one of the biggest movers. We're tapping him down some as a result.
&gt; 
&gt; Briar: Briar has the sharpest mastery curves I've ever seen working on League, and it's not close 😅. People are getting to this point in the curve more reliably and so we're taking her down some.
&gt; 
&gt; Caitlyn: Lethality Cait has been pretty popular amongst higher ranked players for a long time. It's now getting to the point where it's creeping into being her most powerful and popular builds. Lethality Cait doesn't have the greatest gameplay; it's OK for her to have this build, but it shouldn't be close to being the best way for her to play.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr Mundo: Durability style patches tend to benefit Mundo and this patch was no exception. Tapping him down some.
&gt; 
&gt; Jinx: While we want Jinx to have some amount of ""crazy, unleashed"" feeling and having pop offs if she gets lots of takedowns near the enemy base as it gives her a unique thing from the roster (T1 Guma anyone?!), this patch has gone a bit far. We're toning this aspect down, but we still want this to be a strength of hers.
&gt; 
&gt; Runes: We're taking First Strike down a bit more than it was before (benefits disproportionately from longer games) and Phase Rush is a bit strong after we've seen the other rune changes play out.
&gt; 
&gt; Hullbreaker: Finally, we think Hullbreaker is too sharp of an output and are looking to soften its outputs a bit, while still keeping the item ~similarly powerful

I think that if they are changing the rift they are likely or at least should consider using this new terrain type in those changes. Especially with the elemental drake map changes. Deep water from the ocean drake makes thematic sense.
To keep the purists happy, they could leave the base map still and make the drake maps more drastic and should include the deep water.

hot,Patch 13.20 PS Tier List,"PS is a well known youtube channel &amp; meta site(lol.ps) many Rank players and even Proplayers take account.  
They also have global channel in English so check them out.

&amp;#x200B;

They post Tier List contents every patch, although their contents are based on KR server it sure is very useful.

Champion tiers are determined based on data from the KR server tiers Emerald and above.

The criteria for selecting champion tiers is based on the champion pick rate, win rate, ban rate, counter rate, and data in high elo rank comprehensively. A pick rate of over 0.5% is required to be in the tier list.  


[https:\/\/lol.ps\/statistics](https://preview.redd.it/7pbtgwwh9wub1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57500be91d60a6aeab1841803447e227be8c642f)

Let's start at Top. If you look at the Tier 1 lineup, you'll be taken aback.

Aatrox Darius Fiora Yone Jax, all five champions are tricky to play against. We'll only be able to ban one of them, and I'd probably ban Aatrox.

Obviously, the champion that top players have been talking about a lot lately would be **Yone, Jax, and his friends.**

**Aatrox** has a 13.7% pick rate and a 50.4% win rate, looking like a safe first pick champ, and able to take the initiative easily. Compared to the last patch, he's lost a bit of momentum. What we've expected for Top this patch is that champions will decline due to nerfs such as Conqueror and Grasp of the Undying-based champions are going to have a chance, and he wasn’t able to get out of the woods 100%. **He's still a good first pick champ, but not a free-for-all pick**

We mentioned that Grasp of the Undying-based champions got a chance this patch. A prime example is **Fiora. With a 7% pick rate and a 50.8% win rate**, she made it into Tier 1. We've seen some improvements in her power curve, where her first-core timing, which was a bit elusive, has been improved. It's also a good enough card against Aatrox, Yone, and Jax.

If you go higher up in rank, only Darius gets down from Tier 1 and **Rumble** seems to be taking over, So it's like the top players' preferences are almost somewhat the same. However, Rumble is a difficult pick to use properly unless you're in Master tier or higher.

On the other hand, **Jax**'s data is yet again going astray. The changes to the motions this patch have made him smoother to deal damage, And we've seen tiers rise despite a bug that will eventually hurt him. At tiers Emerald and above, we aren’t sure if the win rate changes based on proficiency, And it's not until you get to tiers Master and above that the pick rate is 16.3% and the win rate is 51.2%. At the end of the day, we don't think Jax’s tier went up because his damage increased, or because his durability got too good, But instead we think it's more of an increase in convenience than anything else. So we think it's fair to say that it's only going to rate well for more skilled players. But like we said beforehand, it's also a patch version that champions using Grasp of the Undying have a chance at, So Jax is a good pick right now.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/lol.ps\/statistics](https://preview.redd.it/4crhtlx8bwub1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28d36fe4dd060d50876efa57ba441dd4db001a19)

**Jungle. This is the position that really got sniped this patch,** And here's Tier 1, with a total of five champs; Graves Lee Sin Karthus Rammus Nidalee. 

**Graves is on a roll right now, up 11 spots to the top rankings.** If AD junglers know when to utilize Doran’s Blade And this becomes more widespread, we may be able to see a more interesting power balance between junglers. For now, Graves is showing off selfish stats, and as of today, he’s got close to a **25% pick rate**. And his **ban rate** is quickly **exceeding 20%.**  And yet, his win rate is creeping upwards to the point where it negates this disastrous pick rate increase. The Youmuu's buff this patch has really helped Graves, And the changes to the jungle as a whole didn't really impact Graves at all, so he’s relatively more powerful than before. 

Champions like Graves, Karthus, and Nidalee who don't get affected as hard by the jungling changes or even Briar and Ivern at the top of Tier 2 are in a relatively better situation. In the case of **Ivern**, his **pick rate** is actually still **low at 1.8**%, but his **win rate** is still in the **54% range**. On the other hand, as we pointed out at Top, the late game value is good. 

**Champs** who struggled in solo queue due to **weak jungling are getting another chance**. **Rammus has a 5.5% pick rate and a 53.5% win rate**, and **Maokai has a 7.1% pick rate and a 52% win rate.** These guys are prime examples. Instead, you need to have really good late game value. Unless you have outstanding late game value, you're still going to be held back by your jungling ability. It has to be almost as strong **as the power graph** you're looking at right now, with **a late game win rate of over 55%.**

**Sylas Jungle is an interesting case.** We were wondering if it would no longer be a thing after this patch because **jungling is so hard.** Sylas Jungle itself is still **hard to play this patch, but not unplayable**. We think **he’s defending his data as other champs have received more damage. He has a 6.9% pick rate and a 49.6% win rate.**

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/lol.ps\/statistics](https://preview.redd.it/yb1ad0tscwub1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=403b700a6e09514431c90bebeee872a36af5584b)

For the mid lane, we’ve also picked **five Tier 1 champs Sylas Orianna Taliyah Irelia Akali.**

Surprisingly, **Akshan did get a nerf this patch** and he’s been on a downward spiral. But it's amazing that he's managed to stay on the edge of Tier 1. He's truly a solo queue champion. He has a **3.5% pick rate and a 52.4% win rate.**

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/lol.ps\/champ\/517](https://preview.redd.it/pra5oba6dwub1.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e3c9011977678afea9191502640876c172ceb4a)

**We'll give the OP mark to Sylas.** He has a **pick rate of 13.4% and a win rate of 50.5%**, and he's a champion who should be difficult to pick first but nevertheless. He's also playing a lot of different runes, so we think he needs to be lit up more. We'll try to put together a Sylas featurette video soon. From runes to items and playstyles, we bet you have a lot of questions.

**Naafiri and Neeko**, even though they're **in Tier 2**, are champions with **very high win rates**. We’ll keep it simple and just go over their performance stats. **Naafiri has a 2.7% pick rate and a 53.6% win rate**, while **Neeko has a 2.5% pick rate and a 52.9% win rate.** The difference between the two is that **Naafiri's pick rate has been increasing recently**, While **Neeko's pick rate is going down**. But **they are both good picks.** **Yone is in Tier 2 with a 12.7% pick rate and a 48.5% win rate**. He has the **second highest pick rate at mid after Sylas**.

&amp;#x200B;

**After the AD LeBlanc, Statikk Shiv nerf, the devs gave a nudge to go back to AP,** And they said the compensation patch at the time worked for LeBlanc on AP items, so no additional buffs were needed. Immediately after the nerf, we were told that the Statikk Shiv LeBlanc’s data was chipping away at her stats as a whole. We're really close to the AP build now, and LeBlanc is still struggling with a 5% pick rate and 45.8% win rate. Moving up to tiers Diamond and above, he has a 4.5% pick rate and 47.3% win rate, At Master and above a 4.4% pick rate and 44.7% win rate, and and Bronze to Platinum a 5.1% pick rate and 45.4% win rate. Yes. **LeBlanc is very difficult to use at any tier right now**, and she's still getting picked. **As the developers have said, we wonder if they’ll give us another LeBlanc buff.**

There are more honey champs than usual since it’s after a big patch. We'll give **Ezreal an OP mark. 27.5% pick rate, 51.5% win rate, a dominant performance.** No matter how untrustworthy he’s been at Worlds, **No other ADC is as good as Ezreal in solo queue.** Considering that the recently-gone-viral unlimited stacks full AS Jinx has a 29.4% pick rate and a 50% win rate, You can see how Ezreal is putting up right now.

The viral champion **Jinx** has made it to **Tier 1**. As of today, she has a **35% pick rate,** and her **ban rate is approaching 20%**. The next patch will include a nerf to Jinx's passive stack. But regardless, it's fun, and users will want to experience how dope it is, So ADC players might still lean towards Jinx.

The **buffed Ziggs is doing a great job at bot**. We’re still cautious about recommending Ziggs Mid, But Ziggs Bot has definitely become a viable joker pick. **He's got a 3.5% pick rate and a 53.7% win rate**, and as of today, he's even gone above the 5% pick rate. Maybe without the turret plate gold nerf, he Ziggs Bot meta might have been fully established. It's still pretty good as it is though. He's got to the point where there's no bot champion with a win rate disadvantage.

One champion to watch is Armor Pen Miss Fortune, who is seeing a resurgence with the Youmuu’s buff. Her pick rate is slightly up from the previous patch, but she doesn't seem to be getting much attention. The value of Miss Fortune leading to Youmuu’s-Collector seems pretty good, so you might want to give it a try.

The usual suspects, **Blitz, Rakan, Thresh, and Nautilus, are in Tier 1**. We aren’t going to give out a bunch of OP marks though. They’re showing good, but not great, performances. Maybe it's a different kind of balance. 

**Senna deserves the spotlight. She's stepped up once more with a 9.9% pick rate and 51.7% win rate**. She has good late-game value, and she's a champion who can adopt items like Umbral Glaive and Youmuu's So we think the potential is higher. As of today, she's already over a 10% pick rate So we think it's safe to say **she's practically Tier 1.**

**Maokai, who has higher late-game potential** than Senna, has also had a higher pick rate recently. **He has a 2% pick rate and a 53.5% win rate, so you should consider him. Morgana got patched** And Morgana Jungle has been getting a lot of attention, **so her pick rate as Support has also increased quite a bit**. There was a significant increase in her data, with a **pick rate of 4.7% and a win rate of 49.3%**. However, it's **not a perfect match for the current meta, so it has some limitations.**

hot,T1 Oner Interview confirming that the team will go through major changes next season,"First, its Zeus saying that they don't have fun anymore playing with each other and now this....

As a T1 fan, I'm actually depressed. I genuinely think Oner had a tough split only because the meta was Sej and Mao. Like literally these two champs plus vi were the only jg options.

This guy is a carry jungler player. None of that stupid peanut crap where he only plays sejuani. Put Oner on Lee sin, diana, nidalee and he will carry you. (anything but kindred).

I also think its interesting to release these videos before worlds, it almost seems like they're prepared to lose. Some discussion on this point would be appreciated.

hot,Titanic Hydra,"Is there any champ who builds this item consistenly?

Compared to rav hydra is worse on any champ who needs extra wave clear. (Camille, Fiora etc)

Tanks and heavy bruisers like sion or shen don't build it anymore because aegis already deals enough damage by it's own and it is also cheaper and gives armor compared to titanic's only usable stat being AD, hp is kinda worthless on it's own. 

Not even the weird on-hit adcs build that item anymore (vayne, varus, 98tek twitch) 

I think this is mainly because sterak's is not shit anymore so a lot of people replaced hydra with sterak and hullbreaker exists, so you already have way too much HP on your build, champions that abused the HP-&gt;AD conversion are building sunfire and dealing damage by standing still,  it doesn't have the autoattack reset that used to and Shen got nerfed to the ground, so you just don't build this anymore unless you are doing some weird hearsteel stacking tech",HopeSeMu,1697631439.0,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17apdix/titanic_hydra/

hot,How do you beat JDG,"JDG coming to worlds seems unbeatable 

Top: 369- might as well call him 789 now with his performance this season. He can play carry top, he can play a tank for his team, he can do anything. He plays with Kanavi extremely well to do exactly what the team needs from him.

Jg: kanavi - imo the best player in the world(most impactful) right now. Even more dangerous that he’s paired with LPL’s best mid(debatable) and top. If Kanavi gets a good start, gg.

Mid: Knight - probably the ‘weak point’ of this team. Not to say he is a bad player in any way, he has just shown some inconsistencies especially in global stages. Still not a player to count out though, and is only a weak point due to his exceptional teammates.

ADC + Sup: Ruler is so fucking good at adc. He gives JDG the confidence that allows the team to play at their own pace. Ahead in the game? Kanavi 369 will win you the game. Early game didn’t go as planned? Just wait for Ruler to scale, there’s nobody that can put team fight him. 
Ruler + missing is also very formidable in lane this season- honestly 0 downsides for these two.

hot,Shared minion XP should be refunded to non-junglers,"TLDR: Jungler XP penalties should not reduce the total XP received by the team

&amp;#x200B;

Junglers receive less XP from lane minions prior to 20 minutes. As I understand it, this amount is calculated *after* the XP share is calculated. In the current state, this means that junglers sharing any lane XP prior to 20 minutes actually *reduces* the total XP that your team receives.

Here are a few scenarios where this is problematic:

* Helping a laner shove out a wave after a successful gank -- especially with reduced respawn timers, repairing wave state prior to recalling is more important than ever. Historically, laners were usually happy to share this XP with a jungler in exchange for a better wave state and time to recall, but if the XP received by the jungler does not make up for the XP lost by sharing, the team that ""won"" the exchange will suffer. 
* Helping a losing laner (breaking a freeze, maybe even defending dives?) -- in situations where a laner is already behind, they will often request help from the jungler to mitigate the damage of a losing lane. When a team is already at a disadvantage, junglers who chose to help a laner actually end up reducing their team's total XP, even before considering the opportunity cost of losing camps / objectives elsewhere on the map.
* When losing towers / inhibitors -- as towers / inhibitors are taken, additional siege minions and super minions spawn for the aggressing team. This provides the aggressors additional map pressure, but also gives the defenders access to more XP as compensation. Defending junglers may lose the ability to safely access the jungle in these stages of the game, and must stay further back on the map with their team. Without access to camps, a jungler is forced to share XP with their team, reducing the total XP that their team receives. 

As stands right now, this mechanic runs counter to the intended behavior of XP sharing -- when members of a team are sharing XP, the total XP pool is *increased*, in order to compensate for the lower overall XP that each champion receives. When one of the champions sharing XP is a jungler, non-junglers are still penalized the same amount for their presence, but the jungler only gets to keep a fraction of the XP they took from their teammates. **If minion XP is going to be used as a lever to balance the jungle role, it should be implemented in a way that does not impact the team's overall XP received from minions.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's put some numbers behind this to understand how much of an impact this really has. For context, solo XP is granted at a rate of 95%, and shared XP is granted at a rate of 116% ([source](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Experience_(champion))). A single wave is \~270 XP for a solo laner, or \~330 XP when shared. The examples below are based on shoving a minion wave, but the same logic applies to any scenario where the jungler is sharing minion XP.

**Impact at 4 minutes**

At 4 minutes into the game, the jungler is receiving an XP penalty of \~56%.

Solo lane:

* If a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave, the solo laner will receive 165 XP, which is a reduction of 38% due to XP sharing, and the jungler would receive 44% of that, which is 73 XP.
* The team will receive 238 total XP, which is 12% less than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all, and 28% less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

Bot lane:

* If a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave, each bot laner will receive 110 XP, which is a reduction of 33% due to XP sharing, and the jungler will receive 44% of that, which is 48 XP.
* The team will receive 268 total XP, which is 19% less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all, or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave. 

**Impact at 6 minutes**

At 6 minutes into the game, the jungler is receiving an XP penalty of \~50%.

Solo lane:

* If a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave, the solo laner will receive 165 XP, which is a reduction of 38% due to XP sharing, and the jungler would receive 50% of that, which is 83 XP.
* The team will receive 248 total XP, which is 8% less than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all, and 25% less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

Bot lane:

* If a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave, each bot laner will receive 110 XP, which is a reduction of 33% due to XP sharing, and the jungler will receive 50% of that, which is 55 XP.
* The team will receive 276 total XP, which is 17% less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all, or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

**Impact at 10 minutes**

At 10 minutes into the game, the jungler is receiving an XP penalty of \~35%.

Solo lane:

* If a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave, the solo laner will receive 165 XP, which is a reduction of 38% due to XP sharing, and the jungler would receive 65% of that, which is 107 XP.
* The team will receive 273 total XP, which is 1% more than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all, and 18% less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

Bot lane:

* If a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave, each bot laner will receive 110 XP, which is a reduction of 33% due to XP sharing, and the jungler will receive 65% of that, which is 72 XP.
* The team will receive 292 total XP, which is 12% less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all, or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave. 

**Impact at 14 minutes**

At 14 minutes into the game, the jungler is receiving an XP penalty of \~21%

Solo lane:

* If a jungler helps a solo laner shove a wave, the solo laner will receive 165 XP, which is a reduction of 38% due to XP sharing, and the jungler would receive 79% of that, which is 131 XP.
* The team will receive 296 total XP, which is 9% more than what they would receive if the jungler were not there at all, and 11% less than what they would receive if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave.

Bot lane:

* If a jungler helps their bot laners to shove a wave, each bot laner will receive 110 XP, which is a reduction of 33% due to XP sharing, and the jungler will receive 79% of that, which is 87 XP.
* The team will receive 307 total XP, which is 7% less than they would receive if the jungler was not there at all, or if someone other than the jungler was helping to shove the wave. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How should this be fixed?**

Lost minion XP should be refunded to non-junglers. 

Consider the example of a jungler helping to shove a solo lane wave at 4 minutes into the game. Currently, the laner would receive 165 XP and the jungler would receive 73 XP for a total of 238 XP. This leaves 32 XP that is completely lost just because the jungler is in the lane. Give this 32 XP back to the laner, so they will now receive 197 XP. This is still 28% less XP than the laner would receive if they shoved the wave themselves, but now the team as a whole will not be receiving less XP simply due to the jungle being the one who helped shove the wave.

The new laner XP can be calculated by subtracting the XP received by the jungler from the total XP received if the jungler were not present. For a solo laner, that formula would look like this: solo\_xp - (shared\_xp \* jungle\_xp\_multiplier).

270 - (165 \* .44) = 197

&amp;#x200B;

**In the current state, how can I mitigate the impact of jungle XP penalties on my team?**

* Junglers should avoid sharing XP with solo laners prior to 10 minutes. Not only does the laner receive less XP when the jungler is there, but the XP that the jungler receive does not even make up for it until \~10 minutes into the game.
* Junglers should avoid sharing XP with two or more laners for most of the game. The total penalty to the team for a jungler sharing XP with bot lane at 10 minutes is the same as the penalty for sharing XP with a solo lane at 4 minutes! This penalty steadily decreases throughout the game, but does not go away until the jungle XP penalty expires at 20 minutes -- keep those ganks short and sweet!
* When possible, supports and other non-junglers should help fix waves instead of junglers, especially early on in the game.

hot,DRX Aatrox reminds me of Omega from Megaman Zero. And that's awesome!,"&amp;#x200B;

I had this impression since the skin was released, and now that it's is back at the shop, I remembered it. It really feels that DRX Aatrox took some inspirations from Omega's design; which I think is great because Megaman Zero doesn't get much recognizition despite being an amazing series.

Aside from stories' contexts and other nuances, both are giant dudes with big swords scarred by war who scream all the time and only seek the destruction of everything.

The resemblance is lost with the prestige version, and I'm aware this may be a huge coincidence; and if it is, it's still great. A champ that I like to play has a skin that strongly resembles an antagonist of a game series I love, and that's all I need.

hot,"I went from a 44% WR to 54% WR by using swap pick, to get counter pick Top.","Any other top laners using swap picks to get 5th pick most games? I was having a hard time climbing because I like picks that have some nasty counters, like Riven, or some other melee champs that are feast or famine.

So lately my desire to win has been greater than my desire to play x champ. So every pre-select I ask for 5th pick, include heart emoji's, and also sometimes I use ladder swapping. So if i'm 1st pick, i swap for 3rd pick, then once i'm 3rd pick, 4th doesn't mind swapping, then 5th pick.

&amp;#x200B;

My win rate has gone from 44% to 54% in the past few weeks, with some 16-4 w/l streaks. It's extremely effective, but only if you know how to play most top laners, and esp in plat/gold/silver. So if you've been playing league for some years, and like to play all the champs, this is a perfect strategy for you.

&amp;#x200B;

I basically just counter pick the strongest counters to my enemy top laner. Only tough situations are if you don't get last pick top (infrequently lately for me), or if they have flex picks. Even including those two limiting factors, they don't seem to effect me much.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stomping every lane, and my skill hasn't gotten better. Just by counterpicking top. The only guideline I use is the champ has to be in the top 3 lane winners. It's kind of dumb honestly how easy every game is now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a spreadsheet with who my counters are.

If they pick: Aatrox, I lock in Irelia/olaf. They pick Camille, I lock in ww/renekton/teemo

Darius: Kennen/teemo/voli/pantheon/jayce

Fiora: WW/GP/renekton/sett

Olaf: Akali/trundle/darius/sett/

Nasus: Voli/illoai/renekton/

Teemo: Naafiri/cass/olaf/yasuo/irelia.

Garen (A really fun one): Ap varus w/Barrier, camille, akshan.

&amp;#x200B;

I assume once I hit like diamond, this strategy will have diminishing returns, because some one tricks will be able to play their champ better then me, but it's really turned around my League experience completely. The only qualification to this strat is that you've been playing for a long time, and are one of those ""I have 20-30+ games on every champ"" kinda player, or know how these matchups go.

&amp;#x200B;

It's way way easier than knowing how a skill matchup goes, when olaf is lvl 4, and jayce is lvl 4, both with ignite. You completely subvert that, because in most of these matchups, it's closer to a 'hard counter' (again, at least in plat/gold/silver), so you win most trades.

Even If I play badly, I still beat Garen with Varus or Camille, or beat Nasus with Volibear, or teemo with Naafiri/cass, or Olaf with Akali. So even though i'm a bit rusty on these champs, it doesn't matter because the matchup is so good. Really great for low/mid mmr players!

It's so good, in fact, that I think it's time to nerf Swain mid and buff support - the ACTUAL role players want him in!","Hello besties, as you may know, Riot is buffing Seraphine support. As part of these changes, they are reducing her scaling and giving her more early power - which is like, you know, kinda against her ""hyperscaling fantasy"" buuuuut I can accept it a bit so long as we remain a scaling champ. BUT, Phreak has clearly outlined that they are fine if Seraphine mid stops existing as collateral damage, since she has a super low &lt;0.50% PR in most elos so basically non-existant already.

HO-HO-HOEWEVER, I think this is a good moment to address the elephant in the room: **SWAIN**.

Over the years, Swain support, his most loyal fanbase has gotten nothing but changes that helped midlane and top because of incessant whining from mid and top, the roles that basically had no playrate. Right now his PR is at a whooping 1% after, what, 2, 3, Jhin's funny number of mini reworks?

And THAT'S where the changes landed?

WELL NO SIR, I SAY NO SIR!

We in the support role lost our super cool ""pull whenever enemy is CC"" for these mid fans clamoring for mages to hardly even play him anyway and forcing Swain into a perpetual 50% wr of ""oh, he is viable, not super good tho"" just because they whined and now don't even want to use him? and after all this they still complain about ""oh I would totally use him, you don't get it, I ACTUALLY love Swain and wish him to be viable"" except he is right there, he is literally standing there drinking a margarita in midlane, waiting for you to come inside his loving embrace and you are just there dumbfounded saying ""nu uh"".

wtf? 

Meanwhile, Supp's playerbase has only GROWN over the years, rising to a near 5%PR because we, support chads, love our ""Draco Malphoy's dad whose name I can't remember"" looking ahh crow daddy who probably gives good hugs💅. I say if they don't want him, give it to support players again, reintroduce CC pull on ally and give him MK Scorpion's ""GET OVER HERE"" anytime he uses it.

Anyway, that's just my what I think, I am looking forward to Seraphine's changes. *The Q speed buff specially will be so awesome! Let's go Seraqueens!*

hot,BDS will win worlds. I have proof.,"Just think about it. We have been spoiled before.

It's 2019. There are 3 competitive regions on the world stage, wild cards and NA. The community is split on who to call the favorites. G2 won MSI, Fnatic had two 5 game series against them, Invictus Gaming are the reigning champions, FPX beat them to win LPL, T1 looks scary when they won LCK while the raw potential of DWG and Griffin makes them a contender.

Nobody should've had any doubts who would win after the worlds song was realeased however. ""Fly, fly, Phoenix fly!"" FPX - Funplus Phoenix - was revealed as the champions by Riot before the tournament even began. ""It's time for a new empire."" China were to become the new overlords as demanded by sun emperor tencent.

Why does it matter? Riot released the worlds song ""Gods"". Some of you will say ""Well, actually that would just mean Team Whales vs T1 in the finals so Artemis can face off against Zeus, duh."" And it would be an obvious conclusion. But Team Whales are out. It's not happening.

We were given the key by the casters over and over again to decypher the message. They keep talking about Adam's champion pool, especially his Garen, Olaf, Darius and Sett. GODS.

But there is more. While the song is called ""Gods"", there is a line that reveals the whole truth. ""Once you play god, once play god, they gonna crumble one by one."" The S is missing. Garen, Olaf, Darius and Sett have a 100% win rate currently when played by Adam. Sett however, will turn out to be a false prophet that Adam has to forsake to bring victory to his team. 

The plot armor is too strong, the home crowd loves it and you can make a great skin line out of it. There is no way BDS loses, GOD will lead them to victory.

Worth noting if these are from an early test, they could have been scrapped or changed since then; but interesting nevertheless. 

Specific changes appear to be that the opening to mid from each blue has been pushed back to around the T1 turret, tribrush in top is missing entirely and is blocked off, and Baron pit appears to be far more open, having no terrain around it at all on the minimap.

hot,Does League have debuffs on downrank games?,"I want to know if someone else consistently experiences this.

&amp;#x200B;

I will have games where my attacks carve through anything and everything, and i will have games were it takes 6 auto attacks to kill a minion. This happens in downrank games, where league forces a loss on you in order to keep you at a 50% winrate. In uprank games at the same game time, items and level, i will 2 hit the same minion. The same applies to champions. My most recent experience was a cait vs tristana game, where i would hit her with 6 auto attacks and she left with 95% hp, while she hit me 2 times and i walked away with &lt;25% hp. This was early game so there was no meaningful difference in abilities or items. No traps or nets were used in this engagement, only auto attacks.

Everyone keeps calling it a skill issue because its a toxic community, but when dumping 1400 damage into an adc with miss fortunes ultimate, hitting the whole thing, and the adc walking away with most of its hp, it is hardly a skill issue anymore. In games with identical item sets, levels and game times that kind of attack would completely kill the same adc. I also want to stress that the times this has happened, the adc in question always has less hp at the time than the total damage dealt by the ultimate.

&amp;#x200B;

The same thing also happens when playing master yi, where randomly my attacks will do 5x as much damage as normal, and some games they do practically nothing. I have looked into every single stat i can think of. From armor, magic resist, life steal, weird items, runes, dragon buffs etc. No matter how much i look i see no meaningful difference in characters, builds or all of the above that would explain these experiences. I hope that some of you have gone through something similar so i can finally figure this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, i wish to note this applies to everyone in my lobby. We are a 3 stack, and we all consistently experience this difference in damage output and enemy damage negation (always at the same time in the same matches). I assume many more out there have this issue and it is being attributed to a ""skill issue"" despite no change in playstyle nor build on either team.

Edit:  
Don't bother commenting if you have not experienced it. If you have nothing to add you are just taking up space. The reason for this is that this thread is not about people screaming at eachother, but rather to see if it is a widespread issue. If toxic people spam toxic comments it will drown out the meaningful content. I addressed the usual responses above so no comments repeating the same thing are needed, as the point have been made alredy.

Edit Edit:  
This is not about getting a rank. Its about consistent gameplay even in blind pick.

I want to stress as it's been mentioned in the comments, i am not talking about  Loser's Queue. I have not heard the term used before, but from what i read it is about pairing you with bad teammates.

At one point it sounded like they are playing home and not in Korea. Really interested in the reasons why, since It's been a while since I've seen such big support for an EU team, especially one that is not taking titles domestically.

I know Adam is a big catalyst with the GODS picks and his gameplay and also part of his popularity in Korea comes from SKT Wolf who had praise for his gameplay and unique picks.

But then also rewatching the korean broadcast I noticed there is a big focus on Adam specifically (which makes sense, he is kinda the main pillar in the team and always entertaining).

hot,Pool Party Ahri is Propaganda by Big Riot,"We all know the ""memes."" If Riot ever made Pool Party Ahri (and/or Lux), it would make them enough money to fund the next 30 seasons of Arcane. However, they have elected to keep it in a ""break in case of emergency"" glass case for if things ever seem dire for the company/game.

Well I'm here to tell you that this is the biggest lie since they said that Nexus Blitz would make a return in 2022.

Think about it, if Riot released a skin that was linked to a state of emergency, even if it was a skin you've wanted since the dawn of time, would you buy it?

Of course you wouldn't. Riot releasing Pool Party Ahri means that League of Legends is dying (for real this time). Another big influx of cash wouldn't be able to help them with any underlying issues going on. Pool Party Ahri is a sign of the end times.

But Riot knows this as they are the ones who fabricated the myths of Pool Party Ahri for their own benefit. They are the only ones who know of this one simple fact: There is no Pool Party Ahri. 

They created the idea of Pool Party Ahri as a way to signify to the player base that nothing is wrong at all times. For all we know, Riot was completely bankrupt at the start of this year which caused all of the problems such as the ""cinematic"" we got. But they had their biggest propaganda piece working overtime for them.

Riot claiming that League would have its biggest budget ever this year did not do anything to ease the worries of the player base. But you know what did? The lack of Pool Party Ahri. ""If Riot was really in trouble, they would have released it by now,"" thought the player base. ""This must just be an unlucky streak and things will go back to normal soon.""

And we all ate it up. We will continue to eat it up. Riot could be 50 billion dollars in debt from settling workplace harassment lawsuits and Pool Party Ahri would never see the light of day.

hot,Strange trend in ranked - thoughts/theories?,"Hi guys. My last dozen or so ranked games have been 2v8. My bot lane is just running it down without intentionally running it down (bless their hearts, they are trying). Same with my mid - albeit slightly less. I've had loss streaks before, but what the hell is happening with my mids and bots? I'm just seeing if anyone has experienced anything similar. If so, how did you solve?

# KDA from last 6 games (not duo with/camping top)

* My bot lane: 45/139/78
* My mid lane: 22/54/34
* Me (jungle): 29/26/62
* My top lane: 71/45/27

The KDAs don't do the situation justice because, once we get to mid-game, my top and I are able to somewhat make it competitive, so bot/mid's KDAs improve slightly. During the laning phase, it's absolutely absurd - like, 1-2/double-digits/1-2 sort of stuff. The feed is so demoralizing. Death after death after death. 2+ level disparities. 1-2 item disparities.

&amp;#x200B;

Answer yourself honestly, how often do you really pay attention to the summoner names of other players? Or even use them to communicate, instead of adressing them by the name of their champion?

From my experience, 99% of the time people use champion names or don't communcate at all and the last time I saw someone pay attention to a clever joke or refference in someone's name was probably during season 4.

Not to mention that there are a lot of player who never cared about their summoner names anway and simply used a gibbersish of letters and numbers or generic words, just to have a name and play the game.

Additionally, LoL's playerbase is so huge that running into someone with the same name as yours or someone elses is going to border on a miracle. Unless you're playing in Masters and above where player count gets really low.

There is also the topic of impersonation and use of names of people popular in the LoL community, but that has been happening for years through use of special characters and other tricks so not much is going to change. There has been a very small handful of instances of me playing aginst or with someone who I thought could be a YouTuber only to find out that they're some kid who barely speaks english and knows the most colorful combinations of racial slures in the world.

I understand how people say it takes time to process a ban and therefore they would have to refund LP after the lobby had closed, which is the most common answer I hear as to why logistically we couldn't get refunded for intentional feed. However, in what world is just saying ""lmao deal with it"" better than just changing lp after the match? 

I'm genuinely curious as to why this system isn't built to deal with something that seems to happen every third game. Not to sound too salty, but you can understand why.

hot,"Hextech Gunblade should be brought back. It just needs to be done. If there are champs that need adjustments due to it, it can be figured out after the fact. What's the worst that's going to happen? OP nonsense in the game? It can be brought back next patch, no need to wait."," Hextech gunblade was in the game for 10+ years. I honestly never heard the community complain about it. Occasionally some would say it made Kat/Akali oppressive, but those champs were top tier for years after the item was removed anyway. Compare it to complaints from stopwatch, banner of command, hullbreaker, stridbreaker+dash active, etc. It was never an item anyone truly had an issue with. It was actually a lot of fun, people loved it. Everyone did.

Arguments against:

1. But it ACUTALLY will make Kat/Akali oppressive. - Shut up, who cares. Figure out how to deal with it.
2. But it gives champs without CC... CC. And \*wiping away drool from chin\* champs with CC...extra CC. - So what, shut up.
3. Sustain is not \*stammering\* S S SUPPOSED TO BE IN THBE GAME ANYMORE - So what, shut up.
4. It will \*loudly breathing and swallows saliva\* throw off the meta - The meta is boring and sucks anyway. So what, shut up.
5. Blah blah blah \[insert any argument against bringing gunblade back next patch\] - Shut up.

Having an extra way to interact and make plays in the game via an item is 100x more fun than solely relying on your champs kit. It allowed for more brain-mode plays, and it has plenty of counterplay still. It's not an auto win item. Think of all the screaming the LCS casters can do when somebody zap kills someone. Think of the pogchamps in LCS twitch chat.

Much of the sustain the game used to have has been removed or mitigated, but I don't see how anyone can possibly find lack of sustain/healing fun. It just means that you have to go back and forth from fountain far more often, and are less able to make plays after a fight or duel. ZZZzzzzz. The heal on the item wasn't overly OP anyway. It allowed you to gradually heal back to full health after \~2 to \~4 full minion waves depending on the point in the game, and sustain a bit in lane. Example: if Kayle is vs malphite, it allows Kayle to somewhat persist in lane rather than permanently losing 1/3HP from one mindless malphite Q and having to back, or getting 1 shot ulted. (\*scoffs loudly\* AH HA HE'S A KAYLE player THAT EXPLAINS WHY HE WANTS IT BACK!!!!!1 - shhhh, be quiet).

There's apparently a trend to pull away a bit from item actives. Wow. That's so fun. Only playing in my little niche while another lane loses and having no agency or carry potential is not fun. Gunblade allows for more playmaking and opportunities to the champions that build it. It's a 3600 gold item, so it's something you have to work for as well.

Just bring it back. If it truly messes stuff up then you can get rid of it again. The game is the most straight up dead and boring grindfest it's ever been. The worst player in the game has too much agency, and matchups have too little counterplay. Giving players an item that give people more opportunities and possibilities to carry is better for everyone. Better for me. Better for you. Yes, you. Because everyone can build it. Me, you, your top, your mid, anyone that wants it. I'm going to build one right now in my garage.",detromi,1697628224.0,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17aod2a/hextech_gunblade_should_be_brought_back_it_just/

Not to be too egocentric here but isn’t jungle arguably the hardest role in the game to execute on an actual good level? So I’m just wondering shouldn’t it be like the hardest role in the game is also the strongest role if done correctly no?

hot,"You can't tell an ADC pleading for support to help them to ""just mute"" and then make demands of them late game.","While griefing sure as shit isn't acceptable, it's kind of wild how often I'll see an ADC saying basic things like ""plz stop using puddle in tower"" or ""please get pressure so I can farm"" only to immediately be yelled at by the entire team to ""just mute"" (as though muting solves play issues) or some variation of ""ADCs always toxic fucking report.""

Only for those players to turn around at 35 minutes and demand their underfarmed, chain-dove ADC ""fucking help"" or some variation of whining at them. Whether the ADC has given up or is just weak ultimately isn't super relevant, it just strikes me as wild that it seems to be commonplace for players to believe everyone should shut up and say nothing until it impacts them personally.

The obvious ones are:

* Meta, gotta change things to keep em fresh.
* new champions/the sheer number of champions.

but after 13 years and what, millions upon millions of dollars and you can't even come close to not having both absurdly strong and absurdly weak champions.

Am I expecting perfection?  no not in the slightest, i just want a decent game where I can actually play and fight the other opponent instead of it being a one-way stomp fest.

On a side note, do you think infinitely stacking champions pose a threat to balance? I'd love to hear people's thoughts on that too.

First game, almost an entire lobby of platinum players. Second game, same story. To say I experienced toxicity would be an understatement, but I completely understand why. I had no business being in a lobby with these players and they were understandably frustrated with me.

I understand that most games need a few matches to determine your skill level and put you in an appropriate rank, but most games will start you low and then work you up from there if you do well.

This was the most miserable hour of league I’ve experienced and makes me not even want to try ranked again. Mostly just came here to vent but also to ask if this is normal and why the game does it this way?

hot,A Future Game Mode Idea (20th Anniversary?),"The first paragraph is for the context of why I am posting this idea, if you want to skip and go straight to the idea, it will be the next paragraph.

I was watching some OLD videos from what I consider the glory era of league of legends, I see old urgot, old mordekaiser, old aatrox, old quinn, old graves, old galio, old yorick, old poppy, old pantheon, etc etc. It made me wish in a way that the current players that weren't around for most of these, if not all of these, were able to experience playing all of the old iterations of these champions. I started in season 3, with lissandra's release. I've experienced most of the ones I've listed, but there were even some versions of champions that I wasn't around for. I've seen videos of ap master yi, beta twisted fate, and stuff like that. It makes me wish there was a way to experience them again, or experience something of the past for the first time. Which is where the following paragraph comes into play.

I have a game mode idea, most likely would be for an anniversary event in the future. Maybe the 20th anniversary, just throwing that out there. A game mode where not only you could select all the current champions in league of legends, but all of the old versions of the champions as well. I know some  have been minireworked 3000 times (Zeri I'm looking at you), but maybe to keep it simple, the on release versions of any champion that was considered a full rework. I won't count beta for this since that is considered a testing stage. So Season 1 and onward, any champion that had a previous version.  Imagine going top lane, It's Urgot of today, versus the Urgot of the past. Even if the event only lasted a month, I think it would be cool to let players experience these old versions of champions. To make the game mode even crazier, they bring back all the old rift/twisted treeline/crystal scar items that were removed. Maybe that's too far, but this idea is already too far in my own eyes, but I wanted to share it anyways.

What does Reddit think? I'd like to hear your opinions! This idea is already so outlandish, might as well have fun thinking about it, personally I'd love to play on release Graves/Pantheon/Sylas again (for nitpickers I know I said season 3 was my start), but I know I'll never be able to, I'd like to believe I could play all of them again.

hot,It's statistically probable that a top 8 team doesn't make it past Swiss stage,"I'm not trying to make any commentary, just provide some stats.

If you assume every team will beat all the teams ranked worse than them, and lose to every team ranked better, there is still a 50% chance of one of the top 8 teams not making it through. If you introduce some random chance to the matches so they aren't 100% determined by strength ranking, the chance of one of the top 8 teams not making it goes up, so the true chance of an upset is &gt;50%.

So there's a pretty good chance of one of g2, fnc, c9, or whatever team you think is just below top 8, making it through, even if they can't beat the best teams. Some hopium for the western fans going into the Swiss stage.

hot,Why does it seem like it's okay for support players to snatch other champions out of their main roles?,"I mean, just off the top of my head: Brand, Zyra, Ashe (previously), Fiddlesticks (previously), Morgana, Zilean, Swain (previously), Lux, Karma (kinda... not really? IDK), Xerath, and Vel'koz. That's eleven champions who were not originally designed as supports, or who were not originally designed to be PRIMARILY supports who have received balance changes specifically to appeal to support players and or to balance them for the lane. Including Seraphine who is slated for tweaks this upcoming patch, that makes **TWELVE** champions.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously it's a mystery to me how Ivern has managed to avoid this treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

When other champions start seeing too much play in any other lane they're almost always nerfed right away, ESPECIALLY if it is a support going into another lane. Pyke mid, Karma mid/top, Sona top (and bot!), Janna top, Seraphine bot, Camille jungle, Kalista top ETC. All of these are other examples of champions seeing viability in other lanes who were then FORCEFULLY taken out of those lanes. Why is that not okay, but Seraphine -who is an absolutely AWFUL support- gets moved into support because people decided they wanted to play her there?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I salty because Seraphine mid is (probably) effectively dead in the water next patch? Absolutely. I am a support player and honestly I'm sick of seeing random cheese show up in the role only for it to be accommodated to, but when supports show up in other roles it's almost always swifty nerfed. I mean, seriously, how many supports have undergone a lane swap that has received SERIOUS attention allowing them to stay there? Kench? Maybe Morgana jungle? Maybe Brand (his winrate is .2% higher midlane I guess, it's still sub 50%)?

&amp;#x200B;

A new support comes out and they're basically PLASTERED with little kinks that prevent them from ever seeing play in any lane other than support because the champion design team is absolutely terrified of Renata glasc making an appearance in mid lane, but they're just fine with turning every other artillery mage into a support. It's seriously a miracle neither Zoe or Taliyah have been reworked into supports at this point considering their overall aestetic.",HalexUwU,1697612518.0,0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17akhb6/why_does_it_seem_like_its_okay_for_support/

hot,Auction Madness is the best interactive game to play along with Worlds,"**Intro**  
Hey guys - My company has been working on a fantasy app which is a little unique to traditional fantasy sports.  It is 100% free to play (there is no option to even take your money) and is currently being tested and used for fun.  I just today set it up to work with Worlds and created a few public rooms that I hope people are interested in participating in.  If the public rooms fill up - I will create more or you can create your own private rooms and invite your friends!  


**How to Play**  
Simply navigate to [AuctionMadness.com](https://AuctionMadness.com) and sign up with your gmail or email account.  Once in, you will see that you can choose to create a group for you and your friends or join a public room and play with others.  For Worlds, group sizes are limited to 4 people.  In Auction Madness there's a set time that you have a LIVE auction for all 16 teams remaining in the tournament.  All 4 managers are given $100 in play money to bid on the 16 teams.  **Important:** Each manager will end with **exactly 4 teams** meaning if you are the highest bidder on the first 4 teams, you cannot bid any more for the rest of the auction so manage your budget accordingly!  


**The Auction**  
The auction is a **live event** and has a designated start time.  The auction will start even if you are not there, so make sure you're there on time to be able to participate!  Auctions for this event should take about 15 minutes.  In it, a team is selected at random to be bid on and when the time expires or everyone else has passed, the team is awarded to the leading bidder.  If all managers pass or no bids are placed, the team is put in the back of the line and a new team is selected.  


**Scoring**  
In Auction Madness points are denoted with a dollar sign ($) even though **there is no money at risk or in play - it is a free website.**  If you choose to set up a separate private room you can adjust scoring, but for our public rooms the scoring works as follows:  
\* All Swiss games are worth 6 points each (BO3s are treated as one game)  
\* All 8 teams that make it to the KO stage earn an additional 7 points  
\* The 4 teams that win the Quarterfinals earn  an additional 15 points  
\* The 2 teams that win the Semifinals earn an additional 24 points  
\* The Worlds winner will earn an additional 38 points  


For example a team that goes 2-3 in Swiss and is eliminated will earn 12 points.  


A team that goes 3-1 in Swiss and is eliminated in the Semifinals Earns 40 points broken down as:  
\* 6 points per swiss win = 18 points  
\* 7 points for making it to the KO stage for a total of 25 points  
\* 15 points for winning in the Quarterfinals for grand total of 40 points  


I'm very excited to share this with you all and really hope you enjoy it!  I've joined one of our public rooms, if you'd like to join my group, follow this invite link:

He's at a **52.27%** winrate on Emerald+ according to [U.GG](https://U.GG), and has been hovering around that winrate for literal months every time I've checked. How is that winrate ok for such a straightforward, sit back and farm up champion? Pick rate isn't anything super low, **3.8%** seems pretty standard in such a contested lane full of different picks.

hot,So what does everybody think of the new state of the Jungle?,"It seems as though the new meta is AP/Tanks with AD junglers being unusually weak with the exception of Graves and Briar. Of note, Hecarim and Bel'Veth are both REALLY weak at the moment.

A new meta seems to be forming within some AD junglers where they will do a 3 camp or 4 camp clear into an early base in order to purchase a Doran's Blade. This is in order to be stronger around the 3 minute mark. 3 camp version of this may require taking Future's Market.

Clearing the jungle across the board seems much slower, and Junglers seem like they're being pushed to lower income, more supportive role. If pros played on this patch I think Maokai would be even MORE prioritized than he is at worlds.

Junglers - how do you feel right now?

Laners - do you noticed junglers ganking less or being weaker overall throughout the game?

hot,It's incredibly easy to make mogana jg viable and balanced but the dev just keep missing their mark.,"First off, Morgana Jungle makes way sense than support.  
Not only does her passive and W actually work together but have value and are useable.  
You can use black shield to make sure the enemy can't use cc as a means of escape.  
Landing your Q has even more value.  
The increase gold income helps you ALOT to make your ult viable by buying the 3k gold item that allows you to use your ult in a teamfight.  
  
But they keep missing the damn mark man. Like wtf are they doing.  
  
***How to make Morgana Jungle Epic***:    
  
1- Her ult needs to give a shield based on how many people she ulted. Something like  69/169/269 per person she ulted. Remove the Movespeed since Morgana WILL buy rylai's anyway + Morg jungle has smite.
2- Increase the duration of Q versus jungle mobs by 69%.  
3- Increase her base model size by 6.9% to allow for better intimidation tactis.  
4- Nerf diana's model by reducing her thigh size.  
5- Increase the duration of Q versus jungle mobs by 0.69%.  
6- Increase her base AD to 69.  
7- For an ""Anti mage"" mage, her magic resist caps at 52ish by lvl 18. Change her per level to 2.3 instead. This will give her 69 MR by rank 18.  
8- The Damage of W against jungle mobs needs to be 169.69%.
9- Give her a voice line versus kayle ""I will chain you up with 69 chains and feed you to nafari you disgrace.""

hot,Tired of garbage rage bating videos on Youtube,"Recently watched this video of a professional player raging about how Yone loses to Fiora level 1 and how the ""Game isn't balanced"" because it wasn't ""Close"". This line of thinking and blatant whinging really bugs me and I want to explain why. Video below:   
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BygBy2DiW1w&amp;lc=Ugy6cDblA1\_Ku-BF9114AaABAg.9vqHWw97Ee79vySlZ8gAMC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BygBy2DiW1w&amp;lc=Ugy6cDblA1_Ku-BF9114AaABAg.9vqHWw97Ee79vySlZ8gAMC)  


Now I'm not an Esports pro, but I play a lot of League. I think it's rather common knowledge that Fiora has one of the strongest level 1's in the game next to tryndamere and darius. In this video you will see Fiora engage into the Yone's caster minions to proc a vital. The yone immediately responds with his Q and follows up with autos to begin stacking lethal tempo. They both begin to kite out, the Fiora kites away from his minions and Yone begins to kite into the Fiora's minions. Yone's lethal tempo gets fully stacked and utilizes auto resets with Q to dish out a lot of damage, while Fiora does the same while also procing vitals. The 1v1 ends when Fiora predicts the Yone's flash at the beginning of her auto attack animation, securing the vital proc at the end of her auto attack animation.   


The argument from the pro is that the 1v1 was not even close and the game is clearly not balanced at all because the Fiora was tanking the Yone's caster minions. Clearly tanking caster minions in a 1v1 at level 1 means you should auto lose according to his logic. While it is true Fiora took more aggro than Yone here, the Yone still took plenty of aggro himself and also doesn't have bone plating like Fiora does which is has a huge impact early game on all ins.   


Personally, I find it really disingenuous for a few reasons here and I'll explain why its rage bait. 

1. Professional players should know that champions have power spikes at different levels. A champion may be weaker earlier than they are mid to late game and vice versa. I note this because again, Fiora has an extremely strong level 1 because of her passive, and Yone has what? Lethal tempo and Q? Professionals should not advertise that all champions should be of equal strength at all levels of the game. Even if that means 1 champion can tank 6 more hits from minions at level 1. 
2. No one wants a game where all champions are of equal strength at all stages and period of the game. People obviously want to be able to have an advantage over others at certain time to push advantages. Because of this, there will ALWAYS be a champion that is stronger than another champion at level 1, even if that means tanking 6 more hits from a caster minion. 
3. Even if the Yone did more damage level 1 or Fiora has less base health level 1. Should the Yone be expected to win despite not guarding his vitals? The Yone decided to all in, instead of backing out, he did not guard his vitals using terrain, nor did he win the flash prediction. The Fiora played it well enough to proc the vitals. Why should Fiora lose anyway when she executed the function and identity of her champion while Yone doesn't even have any crit yet? Of course later on in the game it might be impossible to use terrain to block vitals, which is why later on in the game it is more about the number of vitals proc'd. 

This kind of complaining without acknowledging the differences in champion and game mechanics is completely dishonest and does not help people playing the game actually understand how and why a champions should win fights. I would expect high elo players to already know that Fiora wins level 1, and instead of kiting into her minions and committing to an all in where you didn't even get the First hit in, kiting back to the safety of the tower, or at least staying near your minions to keep that advantage. It was really only when the Yone committed to the fight and started taking minion aggro himself that he lost the fight. In this kind of high elo match up, Yone shook hands with Fiora and agreed to the fight.

hot,my thoughts on the jungle changes,"hey :),

I play pretty much league and would call myself a jungle main. 

First off I do agree, jungle was broken for the last few months maybe years, but the new changes took away all the fun. It takes ages to clear your jungle and you as a jungle are now permanently busy with farming your camps. I guess that this is fine as you have less oportunity to gank, but at the same time, if you power farm, you will be behind in gold to all laners. 

I talked to a few friends and they got a similiar feeling.

I thought, that maybe it would be a great change to drastically lower the gold and xp a camp can give. At the same time decrease a camps hp and resistances and respawn timer. 

That way the satisfactory level is way higher as you are still busy farming, but dont feel like playing the game in slow motion. At the same time jungle tracking becomes a more important skill, as a jungle can rotate way more. And more importantly: currently you have to perma farm, as catchup xp is lowered and you can fall behind 1-2 lvls in jungle just by ganking. But because clearing takes so long, you have just small time frames with long pauses, where you are able to access a specific lane. With my proposed changes, you would have more, but smaller timeframes you could use for a gank, but because of the higher clear speed, a good jungler can take your whole jungle on the other map side in the same timeframe. 

Maybe I am too low elo, but I think those changes would massivly improve satisfaction levels in jungle, because currently clearing camps takes all the fun away. (Atleast for me)

hot,"When are tower plates start going to do their job and make towers harder to kill instead of encouraging snowballing, punishing map awareness, and discourage toplaners from taking teleport?","This applies to basically every lane since it feels like you can count the characters without attack speed boosts on one hand these days, but Toplane in particular suffers. It used to be I almost never bothered taking ignite top as I prefer cautious play and working with my team, but now leaving lane for any purpose - including actually just getting killed - results in your opponent getting even more of a gold lead, and most likely knocking your tower down to near half HP. 

It's even worse if someone as demolish. Just defend your tower from someone who just got a huge gold and XP lead on you. Demolish plus an attack speed boost or something else that can wreck a tower, like Nasus? Good luck.

hot,Why not display each players' gold in game?,"TL;DR: Gold should be displayed in game. Current champ power comparisons don't give good information, and players get wrongly flamed for bad KDA if they're impacting the game well by other means. Estimating power levels without a gold display isn't fun skill expression, and there would still be skill expression in comparing matchups and gold/items/levels. 

Why hide stats to make it harder to tell who's actually winning the game? Currently, we have to compare items, look at CS, and look at KDA to tell roughly how much gold a player has, and this still isn't the most accurate. Pro games already have gold display since it's important to know who's likely stronger in fights. This doesn't mean we should get rid of CS, KDA, or item displays, just show gold as well.

* CS isn't a very good indicator of anything. All it does is tell you roughly how well you've been playing your lane compared to your opponent, or how close you are to optimal 10cs/m. It gets especially worse when compared to jungle since camps don't track CS in a similar way. This sometimes results in players flaming junglers or junglers flaming everyone else for misunderstanding how CS works.
* Tower plate gold is completely impossible to track unless they've spent it on items. If two laners CS are the same, you might think they're doing the same in lane, but if one has gotten 4+ plates, they're actually way stronger. You can look at each turret pre-14 minutes to see plates taken, but after 14 minutes, good luck.
* Comparing items is the biggest chore of all. You have to look at each item, compare to components, compare to boots, and compare the prices of items. I'm not sure anyone can perfectly calculate gold from people's inventories, especially in-game when time is sensitive. Therefore, it's only a rough estimation of someone's power. Especially since full items vary widely in price, anywhere from 2100g to 3600g.
* KDA is the most stigmatized stat and probably the one most used to quickly check a player's current power. However, it's one of the worst indicators since assists vary a lot in the amount of gold they reward and shutdowns are all over the place. I've often seen toplaners be 2/5, so my team underestimates them, not realizing they've gotten plates, towers, and lots of shutdown gold, making them easily as strong as the 10/5 ADC. KDA is also the root of lots of flame from even experienced players misunderstanding the impact a player has on a game. 
* Say what you want about Thebausffs, but he's a good example of how KDA doesn't always translate to game impact. He's a multi-year challenger players who's gotten rank 1 before with a unique playstyle of trading his life for perfect CS, tower plates, towers, and tower damage. He'll often have lots of deaths and very negative KDA but still be the most fed player in the game.
* Shutdowns, objective bounties, and laners taking random jungle camps makes gold even harder to track. Why be forced to estimate it all the time, why not just give this type of information?

The only argument I can see in favor of keeping a gold display out of the game is ""skill expression,"" but to those who feel that way, I ask, *is estimating gold amounts a fun way to express your skill?* There are already a million fun skill expressive aspects of league like champion mastery, item builds, macro strategy, game knowledge, etc. If gold was displayed, you'd still have to estimate a players' actual champion strength relative to yours. Can a 5000g level 13 Jax beat a 6500g level 12 Master Yi? You'd still have to compare levels, items (especially defensive items), and champion matchups. In my opinion, hiding those gold values doesn't make this power comparison any more interesting. In fact, I believe displaying gold will open up the playerbase to more diverse strategies for getting ahead in game, saving them from getting wrongly flamed for having a bad KDA if they're impacting the game well by other means.",Masterfulidea,1697581173.0,0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17aaghc/why_not_display_each_players_gold_in_game/

hot,"It really boggles my mind that people say ""Jinx's passive being stackable doesn't change anything"" (With terrifying math)","One thing I keep seeing is the random and wrong statement that ""Jinx would have won that fight last patch anyway"", ""The passive being stackable doesn't change anything"",...  
First off there are close fights where this passive compeletly throws the game off balance.  
Secondly, it's not just about winning the fight. She is ending games way too quickly right after a team fight, before if she won the fight they got inhib and backed off but now she can insta remove turrets. In fact after a team fight jinx is able to takedown turrets faster than she takes canon pre fight.  
  
13.19 All ranks based on lolalytics:  48.20%  
13.20 All ranks based on lolalytics:  51.07%(2.87% gain)  
  
13.19 Emerald+ranks based on lolalytics:  49.83%  
13.20 Emerald+ ranks based on lolalytics:  52.03%(2.2% gain)  
  
13.19 D2+ ranks based on lolalytics:  49.43%  
13.20 D2+ ranks based on lolalytics:  51.72%(2.29% gain)    
  
Now she did get 2 more buffs this patch. 100 --&gt; 105 hp growth and slight base base damage and AD ration on ult. 5 seconds off ult as well.  
  
But those buffs alone are NOT strong enough on their own to make it a 2% difference.  
Let's look at some [CHARTS](https://imgur.com/a/GtwN0WL) .  
As you can see she has gotten a MASSIVE boost of **5% WINRATE** in mid game and that is all due to her getting 5 stacks from a team fight and having the ability to end the game at around 25 minute by insta removing turrets.  
   
  
If you look at 15-20 to 25-30 part of the game length you can see a noticeable curve and slightly reduced game times between those times.  
  
Now jinx deserved buffs for sure, she was one of the worst ADCs for sure but the direction of the buff is just toxic.  
No champion should be able to remove turrets with that speed just because they won a team fight that they could have done barely any damage and just got 5 assists.  
  
In fact hasn't jinx's passive has always been an issue? if you give her 1 AD too much she kills 1 person fast enough to turn it into a penta and if you give her 1 less AD then she can't even get any kills at all.",Cumcentrator,1697400396.0,647,239,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178nrxk/it_really_boggles_my_mind_that_people_say_jinxs/

hot,"The issue with league is, that farming isn't rewarded anymore","Think about it, old league rewarded farming much more than new league did. For example, if you splitpushed at 15-16 minutes in the game, while everybody else was fighting for no objective aram midlane. You pushed a wave, into a camp that was killed in 3seconds, doing no dmg to you, into the next sidelane wave, into a enemy camp, into a recall.   
And today, the camp will kill you at 15minutes or half hp you down, while forcing you to waste 15seconds on it, or ur entire mana just before you can push out the next wave, and if a fight happened  near by, well now you feel bad because you lost all ur hp to fight.   


So now ur telling urself, skip the camp, just push the wave, well now you only got 2 waves worth of value and have to wait another 30seconds for the next minion wave, while ur entire team probably got aced 5v4 meanwhile. Great, good payoff.   
honestly this might be just the biggest reason why splitpushing is so much worse nowadays compared to the past, and feels so unrewarding today.  


In the past players got punished who burgerflipped midlane aramfights over and over with no clear outcome between the two teams, because you did this splitpush strat 3 times in a row, and now all of a sudden you had massive EXP/GOLD lead vs everybody else.

I watched the games back over since that schedule is leaving me delirious at 4:30 am trying to finish watching the series.

It’s incredible to me that leading up to worlds there’s always so much talk around mid and adc players and who will carry hardest, but after watching those games back over, two of those games were lost had Labrov not played the way he did.

He’s playing with an underwhelming adc and still finding angles. Game 4 he rotates top at lvl 4 to kill Jax and get Adam ahead. The entirety of game 3 he was finding crazy hex-flash angles and making sure he was aware of his adc and perfect peeled in so many situations. Even in the losses he’s trying so hard to get Crownie gold or peel for Nuc, rotating to Adam to try to get him ahead or help save his lane wave state.  Watching him take the right traps to allow for his team to path, flanking to provide pressure on the enemy carry, and even walk through lanes to pull waves or stop a shove by just tanking for 2-3 seconds.

There were so many small things that Labrov did aside from his massive frontline/peel.

hot,I can't with those toxic people in soloQ,"All I want from this game is to achieve Gold IV and that's it. But the problem is, only 1 of 5 games are with normal people in bronze/silver elo. The amount of time wasted on Rift because of trolls who ping, type, int, afk and after all don't want to surrender makes me wanna cry, litterally.

Here you have a few examples:

1. Illaoi top, ganked 2 times by enemy jungler, so she decided that ""we don't deserve a win"". When our jungler went top she just stood and watched angry how our Diana died alone. Didn't participate in any teamfight. **33 minutes wasted.**
2. Katarina, after 43 games had avg 14/5 but in my game did 0/4 and decided to troll for the rest of the game. **27 minutes wasted.**
3. Vayne, did 23/2 in my game, so ez win but suddenly decided to troll, running in the jungle for the rest of the game and let enemies to destroy entire base. **44 minutes wasted.**
4. Countless supports who decide to flame their adc for the rest of the game for doing 0/2 instead of trully supporting them. **150 games wasted**

These are only 4 examples but I experience it every day...  
These people are so mentally unstable and act like snowflakes that one ""KS"" or enemy gank can decide that all you can do is ff, but this is often not an option because they hold you hostage.

If you do stuff like these above, listen to me. We are just people and we do make mistakes, it doesn't mean that we do it on purpose and one situation doesn't mean lost game, your team can still get together, focus and win a game.

hot,The state of ranked in 2023 Split 2,"What is the point of ranks nowadays if MMR is the only factor on matchmaking?

I've seen this posted a couple of times on the sub but I'm genuinely curious what the consensus on ranks is at this point on the sub.

Been playing for a while and I understand why the matchmaking system was changed from visible MMR to visible ranks with hidden MMR (to reduce ranked anxiety and people camping at mmr cutoffs), but as far as I can tell, visible rank always had an influence on hidden MMR, up until recently, where they made it so visible ranks are defacto useless. 

Personally, I feel like in the spot that ranked is currently, ranked anxiety can only have gotten worse than it ever was when visible MMR existed and I very much doubt cutoff camping has gone done significantly. 

I mean if a new player loads into the game and sees the opponents he is going up against are 800-1000lp above him (whether or not their mmr is similar) I just cant imagine he is going to be having a good time. 

[Take this game for example : 4 rank divisions in one ranked game. ](https://preview.redd.it/05a0pnbu5oub1.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=040f7d4560adf6d669f3f66435bde4d5a5141ed4)

I feel old champs are so damn nukey these days, using skills at me and melting my entire HP in a few hits. Ads used to be like Aps.  
I know it seems off-topic, but I think they should make hard champions by design, and not just add more buttons and call it hard. I mean, they have already tried to make hard champions, but they have failed (like Aphelios and Ksante). While challenging, the challenge was intended to be the hardest they claimed to be, it wasn't something like a final ultimate attack from certainlyT. Overloaded champions like Yasuo (who isn't really overloaded now) have an insanely unique playstyle that makes them difficult while having a lot of buttons, and new ones don't even have that.

hot,What do people think about laser beam Jinx and lethality ult-bot Caitlyn in bot lane?,"I'm sure most people have seen it by now from the countless clips uploaded to highlight channels but Jinx is blatantly overpowered right now from the buffs this patch that allow her to chain her passive where she gets more than 10+ AS and allow you to instantly finish the game if you're close to the enemy nexus. She's currently 51% winrate with a 25% pick-rate that rivals Kai'sa. Riot nerfed Sett before for the same reason that occasionally he built the 'mathematically correct' sett build allowing you to OS people with his W. This is the same situation.

Caitlyn is in the same boat - don't judge her winrate by the crit build, but if you switch to lethality build her winrate shoots up to ~57% with a very significant amount of matches. She essentially stacks lethality becoming a menace as a lane-bully and when she hits 3 items she becomes an ult bot which combined with first strike and axiom arc allows her to snowball gold just by pressing one button. Her ultimate can literally one shot any non-tank in the game. I don't think that's okay, and it makes for a pretty boring playstyle in the botlane.

hot,How do you play as ADC when your front liners don't engage?,"So I've hit diamond (euw) on all roles except ADC. I'm pretty much one tricking Twitch as he's the only one that I enjoy playing.

One problem I'm encountering very often and I don't know how to overcome is actually being able to use my lead to win us games because my team refuse to tank damage and let me pop off.

So let's say i'm 7-0. Destroyed my lane, but let's say another couple of lanes on my team have hard lost (standard scenario). I know I'm in a position to carry the game. I'm turning up and pinging objectives knowing crucial team fights are likely to break out. My \[Insert Front Line Top Laner or Jungler here\] are watching the enemy team take Drake/Baron. They're moving back and fourth with no purpose. I'm pinging assistance inside the drake pit to tell them to go in. It literally doesn't matter if they die, I know with my superior positioning, mechanics and gold advantage I can win us the team fight and objective. All the while I'm waiting safely around the corner waiting to Twitch Q my way into the fight once it's begun and crucial CC abilities from the enemy are used.

BUT NO........ My front liner doesn't want to go in. Instead watches them take the objective (front row cinema ticket) before the enemy team collapse onto my front liner and just explode him before I can even help. By this point, nobody else is even around bc they've run away after seeing the objective has been taken. It's either a 5v2 with my front liner which I really don't wanna do no matter how fed I am (and the bounty I have) or we just never get to fight.

PLEASE tell me what I'm supposed to do in these situations? This is happening in plat/emerald MMR games btw. Front liners not front lining.",Dirtyden13,1697542357.0,0,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179w8ze/how_do_you_play_as_adc_when_your_front_liners/

hot,The new ranked restrictions are not the solution.,"I have been playing this game for years now and these new chat/ranked restrictions have been the worst thing riot has ever done, let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

Chat and ranked restrictions (yes they come in pairs) only target people who typed something that the system deems offensive, soft inting and inting in general is not target or resolved by this new system. All this system does is punish human interaction in game (eg: I got a chat and ranked restriction for typing ""the enemy comp is cancer"").  


And in my opinion, the punishment should be proportional to the crime, if someone is being a meanie in chat, forcing them to play game modes they dont like and taking away their ability to communicate will only make matters worse for  everyone. People who play video games or go outside will know that banter is a normal part of human interaction, calling something I did retarded or somebody else a dick  for smiting a cannon is totally normal.

  
And to the people who complain about ""toxicity"", just mute and let us enjoy the game.",Stalt_,1697568215.0,0,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17a5f7k/the_new_ranked_restrictions_are_not_the_solution/
hot,Why not add ranked decay for every rank instead of splitting the season into 3 ?,"The whole point of splits was because people reached their desired ranks in the start of the year and then camped them for the rest of the season. So why not add ranked decay ? The current diamond decay system would work perfectly in the ranks below (higher elo is more strict). Basically you can have up to 28 banked days, so 28 days that you can not play and perserve your rank. Every single game you play adds 7 days to that counter. So you have to basically play 1 game per week or 4 games per month. The decay would be 50lp per day if your banked days are over and you drop a maximum of 400lp. (numbers could vary and change, obviously)

That is pretty easy on the player even if they have a busy life. Morever, in the end of each month, reward players with something for being X rank. So that there is motive to play throughout the whole year.

3 ranked splits feels more like a chore to regain your old rank every time instead of a fun experience. You are not going to be playing to climb higher or maintain your rank, you will be playing to just get back to it. Not very exciting if you ask me.

By not having imports it would force NA to value development and it would motivate more players to try to go pro because it’s possible. There would likely be less turnover and more commitment to players long term development rather than replacing them the moment they had a bad set of games.

hot,Current state of the game (Jungle/ADC),"**Disclaimer**: My goal is not to generate drama/hate but rather to start a discussion. I'm not the ultimate authority, and I might not be the best player, but I'm here to share my perspective.

Good evening, gentlemen. After playing this game since 2013, I'd like to share my opinion on why I'm not enjoying the current state of the game. I've been playing inMaster as a support for quite some time now, and I've noticed several things that bother me. I wanted to get this off my chest and see if I'm the only one who thinks this way...

1. **Jungle** \-&gt; Literally, every game from D1 and above is solely dependent on the jungle. It's like a best jungle wins scenario. In several games, I've started an experiment of looking at the KDA of both junglers at the end of the game, and the winning team always has the jungler with better performance, and it's always a significant difference. Practically 90% of the games are like this. Basically, the feeling you get is that when you queue up, no matter what you do, it's best jung wins. It's like gambling, hoping for a good jungle to be on your team. As a support, I try to secure objectives and make invades, but if my jungler is not paying attention and doesn't read the game correctly, what's the point of me playing well? In the end, League of Legends has become a game where one person can carry the match, and there's almost nothing I can do.
2. **ADC** \-&gt; Currently, it's the most frustrating lane to play. I've seen numerous games where a 14/3 ADC loses the game and becomes irrelevant. If you don't play PERFECTLY, you can't achieve much, while a Malphite who throws a tire and jumps into your face wins the game. This used to be my main lane, but as time went on, playing ADC became the worst possible experience. Not even when I'm winning I have fun. Most of your game is spent farming and praying to get three items to start making an impact, while a one-item Aatrox is already a god. Moreover, every month, more champions with five dashes appear, making your feeble flash and nothing essentially the same.

TL;DR: In high elo, 90% of the games are decided by the best jungler, and playing ADC is currently the worst experience.

What would I do? I don't know; I'm not a game designer. Riot is paid to solve this, but they seem busy making skins for Lux. Personally, I wouldn't mind if they removed the jungle from the game.",remi-ok,1697508781.0,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179niei/current_state_of_the_game_jungleadc/

* Grant them the same XP nerfs from minions (somewhat what junglers have) if not around the main ally

I am so free to \*steal\* u/IrrsinnIsReal [post from last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/y83yzm/worlds_2022_pass_is_worse_for_token_generation/) and continue it, since they seem to be ignoring this.

I was looking through the Event Pass page and realized they did cut Event XP through missions this year.

The below table uses 70 SR Games, 50% WR with [30min average game](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/r85ejw/quick_gameplay_thoughts_123_event_mission_points/hn5wimt/) time. Why 70? That's the perfect # to secure all weekly and milestones in old passes and the whole track in the new pass (66,66 to be precise)

After playing those 70 Games, you will end up getting 10.5k XP from playing and 12k xp from Event Missions, which will let you end up on level 56 on the pass.

The TOTAL token difference will also not change after playing more games.(excluding '19, tokens per game haven't been nerfed back then)

If there is not a small 2nd set of missions coming (they usually announce them prior on the event page though) then this post will be accurate. 

On a positive note, the Event is on the longer side this year again, after being relatively short last year.

I just wish we would finally get some consistency from Riot after passes being around for years.

You can't go into the shop and buy the pass while knowing 100% that this pass will have the same value as the last pass, cause Riot is always trying to sneak in small nerfs, which will add up over years.

Original order = 1,2,3,4 for each pool

#Original draw:

**Pool 1:**

* **Changes:** 4&lt;-&gt;1**(MATA)**;
* **Result:** 4, 2, 3, 1
* **Draw:** 4(GENG), 3(NRG), 1(G2), 2(JDG)

**Pool 2:**

* **Changes:** 3&lt;-&gt;2**(MATA)**;3&lt;-&gt;1**(FANS)**;
* **Result:** 2, 3, 1, 4
* **Draw:** 3(T1), 4(C9), 1(BLG), 2(FNC)

**Pool 3:**

* **Changes:** 4&lt;-&gt;3**(HYEJI)**;
* **Result:** 1, 2, 4, 3
* **Draw:** 3(TL), 4(MAD), 1(LNG)¹, 2(KT)¹


**Pool 4:**

* **Changes:** 1&lt;-&gt;3**(MATA)**;1&lt;-&gt;4**(FANS)**;
* **Result:** 4, 2, 1, 3
* **Draw:** 2(GAM), 4(WBG), 1(DK), 3(BDS)


# 1st round with the changes (the real one):

**Pool 1 vs Pool 4**

1(GENG) vs 2(GAM)

3(NRG) vs 1(WBG)

4(G2) vs 3(DK)

2(JDG) vs 4(BDS)



**Pool 2 vs Pool 3**

2(T1) vs 4(TL)

4(C9) vs 3(MAD)

3(BLG) vs 1(KT)¹

1(FNC) vs 2(LNG)¹

*Obs ¹: LNG was draw to be against BLG before KT, but it had to move bellow to face FNC since same region teams can't face each other on the first round.*

# 1st round, without any changes (what if...?):

**Pool 1 vs Pool 4**

G2 vs GAM

NRG vs DK

GENG vs WBG²

JDG vs BDS²     

*Obs ²: BDS would be draw against GENG, implying WBG vs JDG, so BDS would move bellow to face JDG.*



**Pool 2 vs Pool 3**

FNC vs TL³

C9 vs MAD³      

T1 vs LNG

BLG vs KT

*Obs ³: MAD would be draw against FNC and moved bellow to face C9.*

# TL;DR: What would've changed:

**Pool 1 vs Pool 4**

- G2 would face GAM, both sides would've it easier than the real one.
- NRG would face DK, still bad for NRG but better for DK.
- Mata would get his KR vs CH matchup with GENG vs WBG. 
- BDS destiny was inevitable.

hot,Crystal Ball Pick'Em - Provisional Result - Play-In Day 6," 

Hello, 

Sorry for not being able to post here yesterday. 

Here are the most notable changes for today:

* BDS reverse swept PSG, sorry for those of you who predicted 0 reverse sweeps.
* Kai'sa is now the most picked champion while Xayah dropped to 2nd place.
* Orianna joins Maokai as the most banned champion and both Neeko and Rumble get on the board.
* Viego makes an appearance as the champion with the 2nd highest WR with 71%.
* Three more champions join Rell and Maokai as the champions that have been played in more than one role: Poppy, Taliyah and Sett.
* The player with the highest KDA category changed completely with all the previous headliners being eliminated from the tournament.
* BDS Crownie is now the player with most kills in a single game with 13 kills.
* TW BeanJ now leads for most First Blood Kills, however as he has been eliminated the most likely leaders are now BDS Crownie and GAM Palette
* BDS Adam and GAM Levi join BDS Sheo as the players with more different champions played (7).
* BDS and GAM are now the teams with most different champions played. If they manage to stay in the tournament for a while, it's likely that they won't be overthrown.
* We now know that GAM is the team from a minor region that made it further into the tournament. So if you picked GAM: Congratulations!
* We have a new longest game: PSG vs BDS which lasted 43:55, just 1 minute and 5 seconds shy from the 45 min necessary for some people to win those sweet pickem points. One interesting fact: Ever since the beginning of the tournament, the longest game has been between BDS and another team.

I only show ranks that 3 or less players/champions/teams dispute. To keep it simple.

*Why doesn't the image show Maokai as been played in 3 different roles?*

Since last year Riot counted Seraphine, who didn't buy a support item but was played by a support player, as Support i'm using that precedence as a rule. So basically if Maokai was played by a support player, regardless of having bought a support item or not, i'm going to count him towards being played as a Support.

hot,Average Emerald Game,"Just played this game, and I find it so frustrating that with 83k dmg and 23 kills there is no way in hell im able to carry this team. Toplane had a rough matchup into teemo but still did decent, blitz hit his hooks, zac tanked what he could but often left me and Jinx alone vs rammus.  


Jinx on the other hand did nothing this game, for some reason this emerald player did not think that buying infinity edge was a good choice, so instead opted for Stormrazor.   


Yes I could have built Liandrys to do some max% hp dmg, but it would then hurt my damage against the carrys. How can rammus be able to carry this team just because he is a tank, while the Xerath with 23 kills cant make a dent in his hp?

If it's not a rammus that stand 1v5 and wont die it's a Yone splitpushing with hullbreaker that needs 2+ people to stop. Tanks and bruisers are just too strong to the point other classes dont stand a chance.

In this case we lost in draft, since we would have been forced to pick an adc like vayne with % hp damage or some other champion who can handle rammus since my spells do minimal damage unless I focus my whole build around him and Jinx kills herself if she autos him.

hot,List on how to beat every team in Worlds 2023,"JDG: Take away playmaking mids from Knight (ban Syndra in Orianna matchup) , pick ADCs that can clutch (Xayah, Kaisa). Be top-level in macro. You have to understand that they lose teamfights only via explosive damage/clutch plays. They know too much about stable, slow, and steady teamfighting and draft perfectly around that. 

Phalanx formation around Ruler is nigh impossible to beat in Bo5, but smashable in Bo3 because they always experiment their vanguards/playmaker champion drafts against the style of a certain team



BLG: Do not overshove your lanes. No hitting/skirmishes when your HP is lower than them. Slow down Bin (if he isnt winning trades) = BLG slows down completely. Beat them by tracking where XUN is at all times. As they need XUN to start deathballs and stress out teams. 




LNG: Ban Scout Azir, GALA Kaisa+Xayah. Do JDG/Gen.G Phalanx formation where you protect ADC. Do not do flippy skirmish around GALA early. As their draft indexes on rolling from the botlane. 



WBG: Ban Weiwei Rell, Light Kaisa. Their botlane cannot win in isolation. TheShy will always give you gank windows because he will always trade: his whole philosophy revolves around: ""me higher HP than you, we fight because me better"". Pick hard punish champs with a lot of CC to prevent Light and Xiaohu from having sparks of genius. If not, draft to smash botlane. 



GEN.G: Draft to run at them. Draft a Composition where if your team has higher hp pools  - - &gt; Gen.G will get rolled. As much as Peanut cheeses, the way Gen.G wins is by damage output. That inherently means you need to have world-class draft creativity and hands. Ban away Sejuani. 



T1: Ban Azir, Xayah. No playmaking.  Play Zeri and phalanx protect. Make T1 play like shit by ganking Faker/Zeus via teleport timings. These two are the mental weakpoints. Impossible to beat if you dont have a toplaner as good as Zeus, as they are the best team in the World when Zeus is confident. But Zeus tilts a lot after lost teamfights (toplaner) and he tunnels on plates, and is thus gankable. they cannot teamfight as effectively when Zeus is dead. 



Catch Keria when he's trying to initiate a fight. The danger in lane is Keria, not Guma. Their jungler will never overperform against top teams because his jungle pathing is the most studied in the East as he always grinds and exposes his pathing in soloq



KT: They like setting vision traps everywhere. Trap them as they are trying to trap you. Play 4 group - 1 split drafts. Make sure your toplaner can pass the Kiin Test. 



Damwon: Read and adapt in the middle of the game, not before. What Canyon does tells what lane you should smash. Weak top and botside. Stay even. They get nervous when they are not ahead. If you are JDG/LNG/T1/GEN.G, Deft's brain gets overloaded with macro decisions, and cannot shotcall mid game as it is more important to focus on staying alice as ADC. Make simultaneous cross map actions - multiple things happening on the map via skirmish drafts are one of the easy ways to exploit Deft's role in the team. 



G2: An interesting approach is to win is picking offmeta and smashing lane. Smashing lane is enough to shake how they draft. They will respect Eastern draft philosophy too much and try to copy it and forget their own style. Completely forgetting that they just got hands diffed/ they didnt press their buttons right, and overindex on draft. 



MAD: Hylissang does not care about the cost of death. He only cares about momentum. Play defensive and trap him. Your gold will accrue. They are inefficient and cannot play slow. Cannot play slow = throw. Everyone else gets jebaited easily in teamfights



BDS: Weak early game laning and macro. Do not flip when taking objectives. Either phalanx, or just avoid fighting and crossmap. They will passively lose out via their inefficient macro. Suffocate with wallets, not objective flips. 



NRG: If you're a top eastern team, you probably will know how to download them and get in their heads. Best teamfighting team in NA. But NA does not know enough about LoL to be a threat. They lack info. Will smash you if you try to statcheck them recklessly tho. 



TL: Good at Bo1s because they will always draft more damage than you. They dont give a fck about balanced compositions. More damage = easier to win fights = easier to capitalize on throws. 

But since they draft like this, they are useless early game. Smash lane. 



C9: ADC centric team. Will probably have issues against Jax/Gangplank top players as they will always overindex. And their botside is afraid to take risks against Eastern teams. 

Start dragon if you are an Eastern team. It will always be free. 

EMENES has weak laning form currently. Exploit. 



GAM: Actually drafts better than 75% of the teams. But the macro knowledge/game experience may not be there. Basically, will not be able to play from behind vs top tier teams. If they are behind, they do not know angles = you win easily. 

So focus on vision traps to allow such a situation.",SolubilityRules,1697493672.0,2,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179i37i/list_on_how_to_beat_every_team_in_worlds_2023/

hot,Follow-up on Irelia and BoRK situation from 13.18 video,"Hi,

This is not a post asking for buffs. This is a sequel to the quick thoughts on Irelia in the patch 13.18 retrospective. Timestamped here: [https://youtu.be/5SCAaOGn8nM?t=1134](https://youtu.be/5SCAaOGn8nM?t=1134) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick** **Summary:** 

* Phreak talked about how Irelia is ""tied to BoRK"", how it would be nice to fix this, but it's no small change (he's 100% right).
* I've interviewed a number of Masters+ Irelia Mains &amp; OTP's and put together a consolidated set of suggestions to help with this. 
* I'm only Emerald 3 myself, so I spent more time just listening and aggregating the thoughts of other experienced high ELO players in one place. 
* This should also improve sentiment laning against her as an ancillary side effect. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is BoRK so strong on her at a systematic level?** (Boring stuff here, skip this.)

* Her actual AD ratios are quite weak (20% AD ratio on passive, 60% AD ratio on Q damage, 13% AD heal ratio, that's basically it not counting W). 
* Instead, her scaling works like this. Innately she has a lot of attack speed, some magic damage on hit, and Q applies lifesteal + on-hit effects.
* Bork giving her all 3 of those things (lifesteal, on-hit, attack speed) makes it mandatory, and essential to function. 
* The %HP shred allows her to combat health stackers, but is actually fiercely strong into squishy champs as well.
* The fact that BoRK can slow too helps her land her E which is icing on top. 
* Lesson 1 of Irelia is always: if you don't buy BoRK first every single game you're trolling.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals** (Feel free to skip bullets):

**1. Irelia's general power is not exclusive to BoRK.**

* She can explore other items first without literally trolling. She is not a walking BoRK who dashes around.
* Currently when BoRK is strong Irelia is strong. When BoRK is weak Irelia is weak. Can cause lots of frustration for both her and opponents.
* Riot can safely change items however they wish and Irelia will not suddenly become OP or unplayable, and remains stable relative to her light fighter cohorts.
* Current model of Irelia's damage and gold scaling is overwhelmingly through on-hit items (BoRK, and to a lesser extent, Wits end). This is why you'll notice she dramatically falls off past the point of obtaining those two items.
* People playing against Irelia will no longer feel like she is full build at BoRK, and don't have to constantly check her items between 8-12 minutes out of sheer paranoia she suddenly became Thanos.

**2. Top lane is more emphasized as her primary role.**

* She can play more like a fighter (her actual role) and less like an assassin (long standing meta adaptation). 
* This was intended by the original 2018 full rework.
* She can of course still kill squishies, but this shouldn't be an effortless affair at 1 item. We're advocating for this being more realistic somewhere in the 2 to 3 item range. 
* The Irelia fantasy is about kiting enemies through a wave with her very long 200 AA range, using Q resets on minions and Autos on her enemies to dance around (she's a blade dancer after all).
* Assassin Irelia game pattern can be something as plain as just Q + E1 (hide it on minion), E2 (champion) -&gt; Q + AA, Q + AA, AA, AA, AA... until dead. This executes pretty quickly, and resembles an Akali all-in instead of extended combat like a fighter.
* She will have a closer power band to her other horsewomen cohorts who are also light fighter carries.
* Currently, her ability to 1v1 at 3+ items on even footing is among the worst of all champions who need to function as duelists, and have power budget invested in sidelaning. Cam, Fiora, Riven, Gwen, and Yone all considerably outperform her at 3+ items on even footing against other top lane champs. She will be comparably worse at one-shotting at 1 item, however, which is more suited to top lane naturally having slightly delayed impact.

&amp;#x200B;

**What shouldn't change** (Free to skip past first bullet):

* She doesn't need her overall win-rate buffed.
* Her buttons should still all feel the same, her kit is amazing, fun, and needs no changes.
* Her W and E should deal the exact same damage. (Q should ideally deal more or less the same minion damage). Irelia players have all the breakpoints memorized for softening up minions to enable resets. This is essential to playing her well and distinguishes the player's skill. We don't want to force players to re-learn the breakpoints from the ground up.
* She should not be a universally safe top lane blind pick, and should have her fair share of uphill battles like Cam/Fio/Riven/Gwen has for instance. (You'll notice even a great Irelia player and someone who would play her to death back in the day like TF Blade has become incredibly stingy with the times he picks her more than ever before.) Irelking predominantly plays her midlane now, and has for a while.
* Teamfighting potency remains the same.
* She still remains a fighter/diver and will look to engage on a target, and deal as much damage as she can. 
* She still fights her way out or dies trying as she does now. She does not have much ability to escape - that's intended. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Suggestions for accomplishing these Goals:**

**1. Q does not apply on-hits from items.**

* Retains the bonus of 4 stacks (magic damage) when cast to keep her passive management important.
* The damage it deals can now scale more from the AD ratio.
* Scaling generically off AD lets her consider many different items. She can also scale more smoothly and less spikey.
* The healing is now less about stacking lifesteal through items, and can scale more from the AD ratio.
* Q can have the hybrid damage profile for fighting tankier targets now more shifted into her passive with a better ratio, and less from specific must-buy items.
* %HP Magic damage is now gone from items, and can just be shifted into Q. We highly recommend having this come online when she is already at 4 stacks to require Irelia to land her abilities. This is both what makes her fun, distinguishes play skill, and also help solve the problem of ""she missed everything and 1 shot me with autos"".

**2. Consider reverting the Patch 12.16 Buff to base MR (Make it 28 instead of 30).**

* Follow-up option to further disincentivize mid lane if needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fun facts** (more boring stuff, feel free to skip): 

1. Irelia was not intended to be snowball reliant like she is now. Riot's thoughts on this from the designers:

2. ""Her kit is very reliable, which leads to uninteresting stat checks and makes her more snowball reliant than she should be."" 2018 rework sought to repair that.  
[https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/champion-roadmap-october-2017/](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/champion-roadmap-october-2017/)

3. Keep in mind to further de-emphasize the snowball reliance, they nerfed her early game power considerably in the change from 5 stack to 4. This was a step in the right direction and it definitely helped. We just need to continue progressing down that path - read here:  
[https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/quick-gameplay-thoughts-june-25/](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/quick-gameplay-thoughts-june-25/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing thoughts:**

Irelia's pick rate peaked at 14% near S12's start, and now is a notch above 7% which is a notable decrease given her popularity. If you're a die-hard top lane Irelia OTP, some games you will be zoned off the first 3-4 waves of minions by Darius, Sett, Volibear, whatever. That's fine, the 2021 mini rework made this the case and any Irelia OTP knows how to play this patiently. What doesn't feel right is being behind against that bully champ archetype, getting your BoRK around 11 minutes (assuming things didn't go to shit), and herald might not be up and plates don't fall for another 3 minutes. You're at the strongest you'll ever be and there's not much opportunity to make it count if the enemy is both favored in the 1v1 and ahead in items, meanwhile you need to be mindful of defending lane. This won't be the case every game, but it can be extremely frustrating to experience. Sorry, but if I'm zoned off 4 waves by Darius where he bases for Longsword + Cloth armor and I'm forced to rebound into him, Irelia deserves a better carrot on the end of the stick than ""Well here's your BoRK bro, make it count or forever be a worse Yone/Cam/Fiora/Gwen/Riven (insert melee light fighter carry champ here)"".

The changes above with the right tunings would likely solve this problem. Dedicated Irelia players want to play Irelia, and not be a walking BoRK. This aligns closely with Riot's pre-season goal of removing mythics to emphasize the power and abilities innate to the champions, and not be ""League of Items"" as the meme goes.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR - If Irelia Q does not apply on-hit from items such as BoRK, 100% BoRK reliance is gone, and future power budget is no longer held hostage.** The actual specific numerical iteration will take some careful tuning and follow-up work from a game designer / balancer.

hot,Should Tryndamere's ult make him immune to tower shots?,"I can understand being unkillable by champions, that's fine, but I don't see why he gets to be immune to towers for 5 seconds on demand at level 6. This makes the situation of you take 1 negative trade against him in lane, now he perma sustains up with his Q and then just afk walks at you under tower and you die. No skill, no skillshots, no spacing, just walks at you.

At least with other top champs like Kled for example, the immunity is conditional and it still requires skill to kill under tower. Alongside that, other champs with immunity to towers in dives have been removed to just be immune to champions. Champs like Pantheon and Viego are some examples of this, now they only block the damage of champs because their dives were too toxic with it.

I can understand making the argument of if you take an extended fight with him in the lane, then fine it's not a good idea. But the dives at level 6 are just so brutal and overbearing with no real counter to it with a good amount of top champs except just refusing to play or going to another lane. Maybe they could make it so at level 11 it becomes immune to towers or something, but having it at level 6 just feels too strong into a decent amount of matchups.

Edit: Add this into the fact that he can cast it while suppressed and shit for whatever reason, probably because ""haha old champ"" but into champs like Urgot he can outplay him, hit the ult, get him under the hp, and get the execute and then at last second while getting pulled while suppressed, Trynd ults and Urgot still loses the fight under his own tower.

hot,Caitlyn is by far the best assassin ingame right now,"Normally assassins are balanced by having a punishable laning phase needing to basically outplay the enemy and snowball hard to be usefull. 

This doesnt really apply to cait. With her range she has one of the safest laning phases out there and unlike other assassins she gets to play botlane, the role that gets the most gold by defauft anyways. 

Her gameplan is really simple. You farm until like dirk once you have it you delete 40-50% hp of squishy enemies (like lux). This makes snowballing extremely easy. Even if you dont get the kill youl gain tons of gold with first strike.

hot,We should get partial reimbursement for the December BE Emporium,"Not gonna lie, I feel kind of blindsided by this most recent announcement.

I've already spent all my BE thinking I'd have another half-year or more to stockpile in preparation for the next and that these were all the choices we were getting, but this just feels like a curveball with how recent it's coming up.

When I make this comparison, I understand that it isn't exactly the same because you don't lose the currency after the it ends, but imagine if you had an event pass, and they didnt tell you there are more prestige skins and chromas coming - some people might just buy as soon as they get the funds, only to be upset when they realise the next prestige skin in the event pass was better.

hot,It's really baffling how every rune/champ/dragon is toned down but Teleport is unchanged,"Teleport is basically does the exact thing on mid lane that it did on top lane before unleashed teleport was introduced. 

Adressing teleport for the early game should have happened last patch when death timers changed. But they didnt change the TP mechanic for early game 

It's the same top lane situation. You are not getting punished for being solokilled early levels but ot rather gives you a favor. You can die and tp back to mid lane on a good wave state and get the gold-freeze. In this form if you pick ignite for mid you are trolling. 

This type of gameplay design favors mages which I would hav nothing against as a Mage player but it honestly feels unfair and removes the fun element of playing mid lane. The excitement and the challenge. 

Surely if you go smurf into iron-gold this won't be as problematic but if you play high enough you will understand how this is the same scenario before unleashed TP as top laners just died, winner pushed lane while the 0-1-0 guy just used TP to get back to lane and set up a permanent freeze.

I'm part of many main communities, I saw few things from other communities I'm not part of (For example over a year ago, Katarina mains complaining that the on hit items and bruisers items were nerfed on them, saying that it's not possible to play if you can't os and tank at the same time with their mobility), but It'd be hypocrite to ignore my own community lmao.

I think the most popular thing about Seraphine mains for other main communities is that... We talk a WHOLE LOT when there's something we don't like. 

Be it skins that aren't good enough for us, or changes that doesn't seem to be that smart in our opinion. 

I don't know how far some of us are ready to go for that kind of things but I guess there's bad everywhere, and regardless of what I think about this, I wanted you to share me what you think of r/Seraphinemains .

It can be on many topics, just be respectful to each others! For example, I think that being active and expressing ourselves isn't bad, especially when the point of many changes and pbe is to collect feedbacks. If we love the game we should be allowed to share our thoughts. Obviously, we shouldn't go too far in how to do it.

Doing some posts about it to respectuflly share our thoughts, or making a petition or idk what are okay, but really threatening and insulting others is never good.

hot,Old Banner of Command was more healthy than is current iteration in Hullbreaker,"Let's be honest, the Old banner of command was toxic, I too remember that meta where you got baron and put an Ivern bush on the minion while it four shot towers. That said I think from an enjoyment standpoint that was a better place for the usage of a split-pushing item that also had usage  when playing with the team. We know that that iteration of the split push item has since went the way of the dodo due to balancing issues which was of course reasonable. What is interesting to note here is that I feel hullbreaker serves the role of a splitpusher item even worse. At the end of the end hullbreaker is the single largest stat stick riot has ever made to the point where it becoming a staple item on champions that want to teamfight eg, Yas, Yone, and even 4th on Samira. This not only is the least interactive way to make a champion strong is the sidelane, its not even at the expense of teamfighting power since the core stats are so insane anyways. At the end of the day hullbreaker as has managed to do a poorer job at being a splitpusher's item then its previous iterations and I think that that's a damn shame. I think at this point the item archetype is here to stay, so what do you think could be done to make a splitpushing item that feels less oppressive and more skill expressive.

hot,HullBreaker is just Banner of Command but Better,"For people who don't know Banner of Command was an item you bought to promote a minion to take % reduced damage from enemy champions and turrets and granted it bonus stats on a 2 minute cooldown it also gave all the gold killed by the minion to its owner.

It gave 125% base health regen, 60 armor, and 30 MR and cost 2200 gold - Riot removed Banner of Command because well, the item influenced a terrible meta where people bought it just for pushing and would make a team to protect the cannon minion from getting killed either by poking away the enemy team or making sure they couldn't walk up to do anything at all about the minion.

&amp;#x200B;

Introducing HullBreaker! This item gives (while no allied champs are nearby) 20-60 armor and magic resistance depending on level which is amazing stats and YOU deal 20% more damage to towers! Not even adding to the fact that you indirectly buff your large minion (IT CAN BE A SUPER MINION) 60-180 armor/magic resistance and it deals 200% increased damage to towers!

Not even accounting for the rest of the stats it gives the champion which include - 300 HP, 150% base health regen, 60 AD and a 5% movement speed buff.

This item is literally a BUFFED BANNER OF COMMAND because it can be built on any champion who has the mobility to get away or 1v1 or even 2v1 with the item and completely shifts the game state over to who has the best hullbreaker champ or who has a hullbreaker champ.

How did Riot even think this item is balanced in any way? Just considering a SoloQ standpoint where you have 0 communication, the item has overbuffed stats, and if your team can't match the push or somehow end the game before the top laner gets the item it will be a nuisance all game until you somehow win or more than likely lose.

There was a reason Banner of Command was taken out of the game and that was because it was a toxic item that forced teams into either having it or somehow countering it which with the introduction of HullBreaker seems even easier than actually stopping a HullBreaker champ.",LV99Zapdos,1697518781.0,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179qkbp/hullbreaker_is_just_banner_of_command_but_better/
hot,Alois losing 2/3 games in emerald,"For those who don't know, Alois is a challenger top lane player, he peaked rank 8 in EUW split 1.

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of **the best** top laners in the world.... losing in emerald elo, not once, but 2/3 games he played. Does this mean Alois is a garbage player? Of course not, Alois is one of the best top lane players in EUW. So what does it mean then?

&amp;#x200B;

It means emerald is extremely unbalanced. Imagine you are a diamond 4 player in terms of skill, and you're placed into these games. A **challenger,** no, the **rank 8** player is still losing in these games. So **how** exactly is a **low diamond** player supposed to climb? Well looking at this, there's a very easy answer: he isn't. He can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong here. Alois is one of the best top laners in EUW. He **will** climb out of emerald, and with ease. It is possible if you are 1k lp above emerald, sure. But for low diamond players just wanting to reach the rank they belong in? No chance. None. If **THE BEST TOP LANE PLAYERS IN THE WORLD** are losing in this elo, there is **NO CHANCE** a diamond player will be able to consistently carry the games necessary to be able to climb out.

hot,K'sante feels trash,"I know that this champion is getting his fair share of hate, deserved too, but i don't think this change was in the right direction. 

I am by no means a K'sante onetrick or anything like that, but he was in my champion pool before the changes. Now i don't even wantto play him anymore, because it is just not fun. Almost all the combos were removed, you can not Q3 + flash anymore, you cant E + tap-W, you cant flash + tap-W and your Q3 expires when you ult. the only combo you have now is (E) + Q3 + W + R. Where is the skill expression in that? Why is riot just killing his entire identity? On top of these removes your passive damage in ""All out"" is reduced to a flat 35% percent increase, which removes a significant amount of damage from his kit, understandable so, his passive dealt too much true damage in the late game, but why are they also removing the damage increase of his W? his W is now at a set damage, only increased by the bonus AD from ""All out"". This W change in particular is resposible for extremely many solo kills not happening, because youre not properly able to finish the enemy off. I do believe Riot needs to revert the W changes, 'cause  If you hit a perfect combo on a 75% health target at level 6, and it does not die it just feels extremely unrewarding. All this is not even considering the fact, that you have to channel your W for at least 0.65 seconds, which often leads to people flashing away, of course, the tap W was probably too fast, but to wait 0.65 seconds (0.5 seconds in ""All out"") on a mediocre damage spell which doesn't even have execute damage anymore feels wrong.

You also can not heal on anything else but champions anymore, the overall healing percentage was lowered aswell, in exchange we got 10% more health in the ""All out"" form. This ""compensation"" only leads to more frustration. when you ult, you lose 85% of your bonus resistances, which means you get oneshot, lowering the healing makes you even more squishy, 10% more health will not help much, coupled with his W and Passive-nerfs, you basically don't heal.

The ATK-speed you get, when in ""All-out"" does not even make any sense, because you have 2 AA-resets in your kit, rendering any excess ATK-speed useless. Lowering the damage when ulting someone through a wall was also reduced, should you not be rewarded for ulting someone through a wall? Yet another skill expression being removed. (AP-scaling also doesn't make any sense lol)

So, what did riotgames achieve with these changes?

1. every K'sante player hates these changes, it removes many skill expressions and very much of the fun factor of K'sante.
2. K'sante is still dashing in 1v5, tanking for an eternity, meaning the most toxic part of his kit was not adressed. he is still an absolute maniac full tank, which dashes into 3 people and knocks them into his team, barely losing any HP. 
3. kill threat is very low, as K'sante's damage output was significantly lowered, while also reducing his defensive measures (Omnivamp, tap-W)

&amp;#x200B;

How could riot have made better changes?

1. nerf passive ""All out"" damage, maybe let it scale with lvl, or just lower the damage increase from 20% per 100 AD &amp; MR to 15 or 10% per 100 AD &amp; MR
2. leave core mechanics like Q3 + flash, E + W and the Q3 after entering ""All out"" in his kit
3. lower overall damage of W, maybe take off some percentages, while still keeping some sort of damage increase during ""All out"".
4. leave his HP during ""All out"" at 55%, while lowering his Omnivamp a little (keep in mind, he can only heal himself up to 55% that way)
5. the lower base health and higher health growth changes were ok, aswell as nerfing Q in the early levels

What is wrong with letting K'sante keep his identity and just lowering his numbers to make him more balanced?

Anyways, I know opinions vary, but I'm still very interested in what other people think.

DE "" Wieviele Partien wird es geben in welchem das Team gewinnt, das beim erreichen des Matchpunkts benachteiligt ist? (Aus insgesamt 9-Partien) "" - means that the team that is behind when one of the team reaches 2 wins, proceeds to win the series. (So 1:2 into 3:2 is possible)

FR ""Combien y aura-t-il de remontées spectaculaires (de 2-0 à 2-3) pendant le Mondial (sur un total de 9 parties en 3 manches gagnantes) ? ""- same as German, but with the addition that it has to be a 2:0 comeback

ESP "" ¿Cuántas remontadas veremos en el Mundial? (De un total de 9 series al mejor de cinco). "" - Remontada technically only is a comeback, so it could also once again mean go to 1:2 to a 3:2 win

hot,"I simulated the Swiss stage for Worlds 10,000 times for my Pick'ems","I created a little script to simulate the Swiss Stage for the Worlds Tournament, after running it 10,000 times I got the following results

| Team  | Times classified  | Odds  |
|:------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| JDG | 8994 | 89.94% 
| GENG | 8994 | 89.94%

| TL | 1017 | 10.17%
| BDS |  957 |  9.57%
| GAM |  706 |  7.06%

I used as input the first round team pairings and two tables for Bo1 and Bo3 winning odds for every pair of teams (the table can assume different red-blue odds per match-up). I added a restriction such that two teams cannot play each other more than once (I couldn't find the complete rule set after a quick search, but this is a standard restrictions in Swiss tournaments). I used my personal bias to create these tables so take any results with a pinch of salt.

As a short description of my bias: I gave CN teams slight odds of winning vs their KR counterparts, but also a bit of a higher chance of losing to weaker opponents. I considered EU teams a bit stronger than NA teams due to BDS winning 3-0 vs GG. Also, my Bo1 winning chances are closer to 50% than the Bo3 chances for most match-ups (I didn't consider any match-up to flip odds for a Bo1, but I think teams like GAM have significantly better odds in a Bo1 than Bo3s).

Parting thoughts: I found it particularly interesting that MAD got higher chances than FNC to classify, since I had MAD's chances of winning each pairing lower or equal to FNC's. I guess the first match-up really makes a difference.

Good luck with your Pick-ems!

&amp;#x200B;

**Passive - Mark of Illumination** 

Damaging an enemy champion with a light arrow marks them for 4 seconds. Attacking marked enemies detonate the mark, exploding and dealing (50% bAD) and granting (25-75 with level) move speed for 1.5 seconds.  

**Q - Arrow of Light** 

Fire an arrow of light passes through enemies, dealing (80% AD + 10% per 20% Critical Strike Chance) damage and extending when damaging enemy champions. 

*Applies on-hit effects.*

 *Attack speed reduces the cast time and cooldown of this ability.*

 *Deals (60-100% based on level) of its normal damage to minions.*

**W - Shining Altar** 

Place a destructible altar that mimics your use of light arrows towards your cursor, dealing 60% of its normal damage.

**E - Grace In Brilliance** 

Leap towards your altar. If you are already near it, you jump in a target direction. After leaping, gain 40% attack speed for 4 seconds.

If there is no altar, this ability resets the cooldown of **Shining Altar** and you gain 40% attacks speed for 4 seconds. 

**R - Sunburst** 

Launch a concentrated orb of light that explodes after traveling a certain distance or comes into contact with a champion, dealing (150% AD) damage and marking enemies hit with a Mark of Light.

For the next 10 seconds, the explosion from mark of illumination will detonate other marks, and detonating marks heals for (30-160 with level). 

*Detonating marks on non-champions deals 20% and heals for 20% of its normal value, but still detonates other marks.*

hot,"Worlds 2023 Round 1 Swiss Draw Analysis: Winners and Losers, Advancement Odds, Overall Impact","Given I'm a big numbers guy, I made a spreadsheet to simulate the entirety of the Worlds 2023 Swiss stage about a week ago, [which I posted on Github](https://github.com/ChiefDelphi7/LoL2023SwissPredictions). Now that we have seen the Worlds draw and the first-round matchups, I wanted to dive a bit deeper into the draw’s impact: who won, who lost, and how much first-round draws actually impact a team’s chances of advancing through the tournament. 



[I already made a post describing the methodology of the simulation] (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/172emn0/interactive_worlds_2023_swiss_stage_predictor/), but the crux of the rating system is that every team gets a “power” score that the user can adjust based on personal opinions (and biases…). The probability team A beats team B is Power(team A) / (Power(team A) + Power(team B)). It’s a simple system, but it’s been shown to work reasonably well (and quickly) in practice in a number of contexts. I tried to give what I thought was a fair assessment of teams’ relative powers: East &gt; West &gt; Minor regions, higher seeds generally = higher power score. But again, if you can disagree, you can adjust stuff yourself! However, nearly all of the conclusions I draw below are independent of the exact “power” values for each team; all we care about is the order of teams and the strong East / West imbalance.



If you saw the draft and agreed that generally East &gt; West, you would come to the (pretty obvious) conclusion that C9 and MAD were big winners, KT and BLG were big losers, and the rest of the West were small losers for losing out on a chance to dodge the East. The data generally supports this, but the margins of impact are smaller than what I had expected.

3 Biggest Absolute “Winners”:

1. C9 (Advancement odds: 31.4% --&gt; 35.3% (+3.9%)
2. GEN (Advancement odds: 90.6% --&gt; 93.3% (+2.7%)
3. T1 (Advancement odds: 85.0% --&gt; 87.6% (+ 2.6%)

Honorary mentions: JDG (+2.3%), WBG (+2.2%), MAD (+2.0%)

However, this is a tad biased against the West, as we’re measuring odds improvement in absolute terms. When most people think of “improving the odds,” they think of improving odds relative to their original values (ex. “Twice as likely.”) 


When you take this into account, the biggest winners by **relative** odds improvement are:

1. C9 (12.49% more likely to advance)
2. MAD (9.23% more likely to advance)
3. WBG (3.26% more likely to advance)


And in a similar vein, the biggest **losers** are:

1. GAM (***28.97%*** less likely to advance)
2. TL (17.37% less likely to advance)
3. BDS (16.74% less likely to advance)

with honorary mentions to NRG (-6.2%), KT (-5.03%), and FNC (-4.26%).




However, I think these stats lose the forest for the trees. Look at GEN and JDG, for example. They improve from 90.6% and 85.3% chance for advancement to 93.3% and 87.6% chance, respectively. Their advancement odds don’t improve much, but their odds of ***not*** advancing drop substantially. GEN is 28.8% **less** likely to be knocked out in Swiss. T1: 17.35%. JDG: 15.67%. ***The single biggest impact of the draw is not that C9 or MAD got a western first opponent; it’s that GEN, T1, and JDG dodged eastern counterparts and got a far clearer path to 1-0.*** KT and BLG weren’t so lucky and got hit with roughly 15% ***increases*** in their odds of getting knocked out (relatively speaking). As soon as it was determined that GENG would play GAM instead of, say, WBG, we cut down on a whole lot of worlds where GENG would go down 0-1… and worlds where GAM would miraculously advance. Same holds for BDS.




So where does that leave EU and NA? Frankly, pretty much every region except Vietnam is left with the same number of expected advancing teams as before. Just as before the draw, we expected around 3.2 Korean teams, 3 Chinese teams, 1.1 EU teams, .7 NA teams, and virtually 0 Vietnamese teams to advance. That hasn’t noticeably changed with the draw, at least up to 1/10th of an expected advancement. To be honest, that’s kind of the theme with this draw: “We didn’t get anything particularly crazy with matchups, and no team comes out ahead or behind by any more than 4% advancement probability (in absolute terms).”

I'm a bit puzzled, and I'm hoping someone here might be able to explain some of the arcane of the LP system to me. I've read about it, and I understand the basics: winning team steals LP from the losing team, the amount being relative on the rating gap that separates the two teams.

Still, it seems unlikely for several games in a row to be worth... no LP at all ? What happens with the winning team ? Do someone on their side also gain 0LP ? Does it mean the games were vastly unbalanced ? If so, how can it happen three times in a row ?

hot,"I think the biggest issue with hated modern champions is that they tend to only ""win more""","Okay let me start by giving an example of the opposite of a ""win more"" champion. Let's talk about Thresh. I think he's a great example because he's generally pretty liked and considered to be good design. 

&amp;#x200B;

In a situation where you are in a winning situation, as thresh you have tools that allow you to win more. Good hooks, aggressive abilities, ETC. In situations where you are losing, you have tools that allow you to lose less. Defensive CC and utility, escape tools, ETC.

&amp;#x200B;

Compare this to the most recent addition to the game: Briar. Does Briar have tools that let her win more? Absolutely. Briar is amazing when ahead, even only a few hundred gold. Her kit is excellent for snowballing and gaining traction. Now, the important part, does Briar have tools that let her lose less? **No**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think this tends to be overwhelmingly true for champions released in the past \~5 years who are disliked. They have tools that allow them to snowball hard and carry a lead, but they have basically zero tools that are useful when behind. The characters feel oppressive when ahead, and so forgettable when behind that you don't think about the times you've played against them and won. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even comparing a lot of the less hated new additions to the game: Seraphine, Vex, Lillia, there's a clear trend of all of these champions having atleast a few defensive tools. These champions are absolutley powerful when ahead, but not in the same way as Yone or Samira. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the champions that people HATE tend to be the ones who are oppressive when ahead and useless when behind. ",HalexUwU,1697403167.0,16,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178ormm/i_think_the_biggest_issue_with_hated_modern/

\-------

First off, if you don't want to deal with a support just take your adc out of bot lane\~\~\~

The proof:

[I'm Karthus. ](https://preview.redd.it/fq7ivfm1hmub1.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c446cc2f7e68713165497f6724207fbe04eda26)

Besides the memes of the fact that kaisa can build whatever she wants, I just wanted to chill and finish my placements. My jungler was just mentally done because he just escaped a fiora support to only be stuck with a trolling Jax adc. Notice how Jax is building full armor against a full ap enemy team.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe stridebreaker Kai'Sa was the hidden mathematically correct build that I didn't know about... but  I'm 90% certain my jungle kai'sa was fully intent on running it down and just happened to accidently carry. They were going to go J4, but then said ""fk it, we Kaisa'ing it also over the rift"" (maybe not exact words).

How we won. Kai'Sa continued to just click ""R"" whenever I clicked ""R"" to farm first strike gold. She aced them a few times like that. Eventually enemy got smart and killed her. It seemed like they would finally turn the tides and destroy our base.

But it was a trap. A bait. Kai'sa bamboozled them in one final ""R.""

Meanwhile, yorick tp'd into their open nexus. The enemy futilely tried to recall as they realized what had happened, but then I clicked ""r"" and stopped them all\~\~\~\~

To summarize:

Top: Afk split Yorick

Jungle: Click R, accidently carry Kai'Sa

Me: Afk click R Karthus

ADC: Sprinting Jax

* Kai'Sa pulled 5 clear of Xayah on most picked, as well as picking up some needed wins to bring her winrate up to 50%.
* Maokai and Orianna are the most banned of playins with 21 each, though they are not that far ahead.
* We know have 5 champs played in multiple roles, those being Rell, Sett, Poppy, Taliyah and Maokai. Will we have someone in 3 or is 2 going to be the correct answer?
* Most deaths is pretty tight, with only 20 deaths separating 1st and 9th.
* BeanJ moves clear in First Bloods with 4. Crownie is currently on 3, with Labrov and Sheo on 1 each. Have to see how well they do in Swiss.
* Crownie also took the lead for most kills in a game with 13, this would have been enough for 3rd last year.
* We now have 2 categories with results, as GAM is now the team that advanced the furthest from a 2 or less team region. 
* We also now have a reverse sweep, so rip me and everyone who predicted 0. There was 1 last year, so maybe I shoulda learnt?
* No baron steals the whole of play ins. Wild. I'm hoping we see a lot of steal in swiss D:
* Lastly, it's not a crystal ball thing, but we have currently seen 58/164 champs in champ select (So either picked or banned). Where will we end up?

- Against most other junglers, you can just ward; this will make their ganks telegraphed, allowing you to react accordingly. Against junglers that can either become invisible, bypass walls, or have a long range dash and can gank from different angles (such as Zac, Kha'Zix, Shaco, Kayn) you can ward in other places, even though warding becomes more difficult.
 - This doesn't work against Evelynn. Why? Because she is perpetually invisible. It only works before level 6; after that, your only option is to either give up lane dominance, or risk being ganked by her; Because Evelynn is perpetually invisible, warding doesn't work because you can only use one pink ward, and Evelynn can just gank from other angles, and she will ignore normal wards due to that. You can ward Evelynn's camps to know where she is and guess where she will gank, but that isn't feasible because you have too a limited number of wards to use and it is not just you, but your allies also need to ward her camps, which is a massive level of coordination that you can't find in your average SoloQ game. Also, unlike Rengar, Evelynn can avoid activating her W, which makes her ganks even less telegraphed, even if they will be weaker if she doesn't use W.

- Against most other assassins, you can pick tanks, or bulky juggernauts. They can't be bursted from full health like squishies can, for obvious reasons: health and resistance stacking prevents that. Assassins CAN kill them, but only when they have been significantly weakened enough, or if they are behind enough.
 - This doesn't work against Evelynn. Why? Because her W shreds a percentage of your magic resistance (not a flat amount, so it works even against magic resistance stacking), her E does damage based on your max health (and the percentage scales with AP, unlike most other percentage health mechanisms in the game), and her R does a ton more damage if you are weakened enough. So not only Evelynn can bypass resistances and health stacking from tanks, unlike other assassins, she has a much easier time finishing them off once they are weakened enough. This invalidates tanks as a form of counterplay against Evelynn.

Evelynn is just broken, but people somehow refuse to admit that she is. They say that she is balanced, easily counterable, telegraphed, that only low elo players die to her... None of this is true, as I explained.

Also, Evelynn needs nerfs, but for some reason Riot refuses to nerf her. Why?",Chinese_Squidward,1697499826.0,0,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179kehc/why_people_refuse_to_admit_that_evelynn_is_broken/

hot,High Ping mid lane Tier List,"&amp;#x200B;

[Note: I didnt order them from left to right in there respective tier, I dont think they differ much](https://preview.redd.it/hlxtv1dmyeub1.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e95a51ead8bad79d265686bd04cccb3db31be97)

Im a high ping player myself, i based my opinions on how they playable they are from a 90-300 constant ping range, incase you want to know i myself play on170 ping constant and no packet loss. Now firstly i think i should explain what i think makes a champ good on high ping. There are 5 main things that are challening on high ping, in no order : Last hitting minions/csing, dodging skill shots, hitting skill shots, executing combos and early game as a whole. 

Now immediately you may ask why champs like lux who are quite skill shots reliant are in the higher tier, the main reason is that they make it up heavily in other categories, so looking at lux,vex,annivia,neeko and veigar they all have  extremely good wave clear and/or an easier time csing, they also arent interactive during the laning phase which means they dont really have worry about landing/dodge skill shots as much. These champs also have cc that which maybe on a skill shot,but if they do land it they dont have to worry about any of there other upcoming abilities since it a stationary target, which is alot better than having to poke/ trade on a constantly moving target. 

In reality though most league players will never get to a rank where high ping ( 100-200 range ) makes the game impossible since its may not exist, Just look at somone like flyerbekk who managed kata on high ping, Azzapp who got to chall on velkoz. So just play what you enjoy and if you want to give yourself the best chance then you still have the freedom to do that.

hot,The Best LPL Players to Miss Worlds,"There’s always a lot of talk that even with 4 seeds, LPL and LCK have a lot of deserving talent that fails to make it onto the big stage every year. That is 100% true, and today I want to shine a light on some of the players that maybe you will see at Worlds in the next couple years!

Now just to get it out of the way, the entirety of TES could count for this, but you probably already know them (Tian, Rookie, JKL), so I’m just not gonna mention them beyond this. Some of EDG too.

Now the two big names that I feel have to be mentioned are:

**Shanji (OMG)**

I noticed that there were a lot of OMG fans on the English side of LPL this year, and a lot of that has to be thanks to this guy (and also ppgod lmao). The entire OMG roster had a unique and fun playstyle, that wasn’t scared to go in and make plays that could turn games. Shanji is kind of the embodiment of that, and his Rumble is something to behold.

It’s not really certain what will happen to this OMG roster next year as they probably can’t afford to keep everyone, so look out for Shanji joining a top team and making his debut next year.

**Photic (NiP)**

Now although NiP hasn’t been the same since pretty much everyone else but Photic left, he definitely still remains a bright spot not just on the team, but in the entire LPL. The mechanics are there, the carry mindset is there - it’s just baffling why he decided to ask for Zhuo over ppgod as his support. But regardless, I am pretty confident he will get a chance to shine at some point in his career at Worlds!

There are a few more people as well, but it’s hard to say for sure what their future is:

XHR - super hyped up as the next jungle superstar, barely got any playing time

YSKM - went absolute TheShy-esque sicko mode to start his time in LPL, fizzled out really fast. Still has time to prove himself

Shanks - was previously also really hyped up, but maybe proven not to be as good as thought. Looking lately like he might turn that around though",aplacelikehome,1697430372.0,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178xqab/the_best_lpl_players_to_miss_worlds/

hot,"Teams should get to ban 1 jungler, 1 midlaner and 1 adc in addition to the current 1 ban per player","There is a tension between using a ""global ban"" outside of your role and using a ""local ban"" specific to your role. For instance if you're a toplaner and you ban a strong jungler or you're a support who bans a strong midlaner. So how about if each team could ban one champ from each of the three ""center roles"" without doubling bans to 2 per player (too many IMO).

In S1 each team had 2 bans, followed by 3 bans ""shared"" by the whole team. The current sweet spot of 1 ban per player is quite nice. This proposal would take the 3 ""shared bans"" and add them to the current 1 ban per player, as an alternative to the status quo or to doubling the amount of bans to 2 per player (which IMO would be too many).

However these 3 shared bans would be split among 3 roles. One player is given dictatorship of the 3 shared bans, however they can only select a ban that is suggested by the other 4 players.

When a player is in the ban phase, they select several champions to add to a temporary banlist. The UX would resemble the current suggest ban except also show a history of champions hovered over during the ban phase. Banlists can also be saved and imported like runepages, so you won't have to search champions every time. The one they are currently hovering over is highlighted (and perhaps a slightly larger icon that is still smaller than preselect icon).

After a short delay, simultaneously your personal ban is locked in for your team and then suggested ban list is finalised. The dictator is then given 10 seconds to choose from the aggregated ban list. Each player's banlist is at most 3 champions long, so the dictator has up to 12 champions to choose from. If any champion has 2 suggestions (without being preselected) they are automatically banned without the dictator choosing. If 2 champions are tied for the role ban, then the dictator chooses between them.

Why not top and support? Personally I feel like the flavour of toplane is one of uncomfortable matchups and being an island that needs help but cannot receive enough jungler attention or conversely is an island where you stomp the opponent but the enemy jungler cannot afford more assistance. Without worrying about a global ban (e.g. jungler, midlane assassin) you'll always have a toplane ban for yourself. Two toplane bans would harm the lane vibe too much. Similar story with botlane, since it now receives up to 3 bans (2 personal bans + 1 adc roleban).

###Live Discussions and Post-Match Threads:

[This is our Live Discussion Archive. Here you can find all the old live threads, and the respective PMTs in a stickied comment under the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/wiki/livediscussionarchive)",ahritina,1697333458.0,89,3231,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1784e6c/2023_world_championship_playin_qualifiers_live/
hot,The 13.20 jungle nerf to AD junglers is unhealthy for the game and makes only AP carry or Tank junglers viable.,"Here is the most important change in 13.20: Jungle Companion Damage: 16 (+10% bonus AD) (+12% AP) (+10% bonus armor) (+10% bonus magic resistance) (+3% bonus health) true damage ⇒ 16 (+10% bonus AD) (+10% AP) (+20% bonus armor) (+20% bonus magic resistance) (+3% bonus health) (Note: the armor and magic resistance changes mean that bonus armor/MR will provide similar damage per gold to bonus health)

**Note: Jungle pet AD scaling was REMOVED 10% to 0%, AP scaling 12% to 10%, and ARMOR/MR scaling BUFFED 10% to 20%** The Pet damage is significant because it is AOE damage and greatly improves clear speed.

https://www.op.gg/champions?region=na&amp;tier=emerald_plus&amp;position=jungle The top 11 junglers (by op.gg's metrics) are currently: Fiddlesticks, Briar, Graves, Rammus, Lillia, Ekko, J4, Zac, Ivern, Evelyn, Maokai.

The highest absolute WR junglers are Fiddlesticks and Rammus with 54% WR (this is a ludicrous WR and junglers with 54% tend to get nerfed next patch or hotfixed).

As of now, the top 11 junglers are all AP except for Briar/J4 who are both ludicrously overtuned balls of stats (and because J4 only needs level 2-3 to be relevant, also note that J4 has been broken for the entire year hitting 54% after goredrinker/shojin buffs then receiving nerfs), and Graves because he has AOE and pet damage scales with armor which he stacks using his E (true grit stacks) during clears.

Notably, **Rammus** is fucking stupid with the new changes because not only does he build a thornmail first (pet AOE dmg scales off 20% armor stacking), but his kit makes passive/W do damage scaling with armor. So he builds full armor and clears faster than a full AD jungler building only damage.... with no downside.

As of 13.20, AP-carry junglers have the fastest clear.

But, stupidly, TANK junglers also clear faster than AD-damage junglers now. Before there was a tradeoff to pick a tank vs picking an AD-damage jungler. Generally, tank junglers clear slower because they have much stronger teamfighting and CC for ganks. Now, they have greatly buffed the Armor/MR scaling of the pets to the point that tank junglers actually clear the same speed if not faster than AD damage junglers, so they not only clear faster, but they have better ganks (CC) and teamfighting, so there isn't any point to pick AD-damage junglers anymore and the stats reflect this.

I.E. if you want a ""carry"" jungler, you pick AP-Damage jungler like Lilia, Fiddlesticks, if you like AA-reliant jg like Viego or Xin you pick Diana/Shyvanna. There is 0 point to play AD-junglers at the moment.",AngryjanitorX,1697481472.0,0,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/179d6d0/the_1320_jungle_nerf_to_ad_junglers_is_unhealthy/
hot,Should new accounts with sufficient pvp games played be included in whole normal blind player pool before they reach level 30? [Serious discussion],"I know that the system already tries to separate new smurf accounts from actual new accounts but it feels like there's a room for an improvement for everyones gain.

I wanted to have an account on different server (EUW-EUNE). 

I didn't buy xp boosts and, for me, pvp is a better learning/gameplay experience than vs AI, so it took me 140 pvp games to get my account to level 30. 
 

I've got all summoner spells in after about first 10 games, and after that there was no in-game difference between this account and level 30+ account (besides bought champions).

I know that normal blind pool includes also players who play a lot of ranked but not a lot of normals, so normal games can still be unbalanced.

The game quickly learns what my MMR range is (in some old Game Developers Conference videos they said around 5?)
On a fresh account, player pool is restricted to mostly players also below level 30. 

Could it be changed to pool new accounts with sufficient games played for MMR certainty, to pool with whole normal blind pool players?

With the quickplay incoming, will the rules change?",Hernal,1697441618.0,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1790g4h/should_new_accounts_with_sufficient_pvp_games/

​ **The full list with more details on:**  [**Impact - Patch 13.20 - Deadmansplate**](https://deadmansplate.com/data/impact-patch-13-20)

&amp;#x200B;

# Summary

* **Doran’s items (and Dark Seal): Overpowered.** Corrupting is shit. Long Sword + potions is shit. **If you are a jungler or a support, get one after your first B.** Riot will likely make them unique with your jungle/support item next patch.
* Jungle: Tank junglers are up while AP junglers are doing fine and most AD junglers are bad now. Riot should bring \~6-8% bAD scaling back for the jungle pet. Briar (OP) and J4 are the 2 best AD junglers and J4 sits around 51%.
* Items: Duskblade is pretty much dead, Youmuus is now back in action. Riot just swaps these 2 around all the time. No clue why they can’t balance both.
* Runes: A few untouched or slightly touched runes like Fleet or Phase Rush are very strong right now. Electrocute is likely niche comapred to First Strike and Dark Harvest. Comet loses power vs Aery and Aery becomes very strong.

Buffs:

* Jinx is back in action and super popular again. The R buff was likely not needed, the P and HP buffs on top of the longer games already help her a lot.
* Milio goes back to the strong side. Similar to Jinx he was buffed a bit more than needed.
* With Ziggs bot is awesome. He is also good mid now.
* I love how Riot buffed Morgana. E nerf and R buff to make her ult actually matter.
* Galio is still the same Galio.

Nerfs:

* Bel’Veth got a hefty nerf and even the crit buff can’t make up for it. Triple nerf in one patch.
* Kai’Sa is down. You definitely feel the Armor nerf.
* Akshan and Quinn are still playable and fine
* ZED!!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Trynda had a bug on his E for \~24 hours. This is now fixed but still influences his data a bit.**

**Jungle XP range had a bug which affected Shaco. Is fixed now, but still affects the stats a bit.**

# Buffs

Jinx is back in soloQ and very, very popular and still strong. With the longer lasting games she already got some help, so I think Riot didn't need to buff her as much in one go.

&amp;#x200B;

# [Milio sup](https://deadmansplate.com/data/impact-patch-13-20/#Milio_sup)

**50.9% WR &lt;= Diff: +2.8% &lt;= 48.1% WR**

Games: 73,391

For some reason I am super happy about Milio buffs, even when he is one of the most passive supports in the game. My only problem is that the Q max was not buffed also a bit, like a 2 sec lower CD at max rank, to make the Q max 2nd slightly better.

&amp;#x200B;

# [Ziggs mid, bot](https://deadmansplate.com/data/impact-patch-13-20/#Ziggs_mid)

3.0% PR &lt;= +94% PR &lt;= 1.5% PR

Ziggs mid got a decent PR now and the WR is also very good. I hope Riot allows him to stay mid and can nerf bot Ziggs without touching mid much.

&amp;#x200B;

6.6% PR &lt;= +18% PR &lt;= 5.6% PR

Games: 79,499

I love her buffs so much. For some reason Riot has done a mostly good patch with some key changes to a few champs. Morganas R needed love for so long and the nerf to the E CD is totally fine, too. And she is playable in mid and jungle also.

&amp;#x200B;

# [Galio mid](https://deadmansplate.com/data/impact-patch-13-20/#Galio_mid)

**50.5% WR &lt;= Diff: +0.2% &lt;= 50.3% WR**

1.8% PR &lt;= +30% PR &lt;= 1.4% PR

A small buff, but it also makes the W max 1st most likely viable again.

&amp;#x200B;

# Nerfs

# [Bel'Veth jgl](https://deadmansplate.com/data/impact-patch-13-20/#Bel'Veth_jgl)

3.0% PR &lt;= -41% PR &lt;= 5.0% PR

Games: 35,750

A triple nerf to her was just too much. Longer games means an early game champ loses power. Heavy nerfs to AD junglers. Direct nerfs to her.

&amp;#x200B;

# [Kai'Sa bot](https://deadmansplate.com/data/impact-patch-13-20/#Kai'Sa_bot)

**48.0% WR &lt;= Diff: -1.4% &lt;= 49.5% WR**

26.3% PR &lt;= -14% PR &lt;= 30.6% PR

Games: 319,110

For soloQ Kai'Sa is mostly dead even when games last longer now. 3 Armor gone is a lot. But she can make a small comeback with the right build, and it is not what you think it is. Don't get fooled by Umbral or Kraken. Stormrazor + Fleet is the thing I suggest to you.

&amp;#x200B;

# [Zed mid, jgl](https://deadmansplate.com/data/impact-patch-13-20/#Zed_mid)

PARTY HARD. To be fair, I am not a person who dislikes Zed a lot, but I do hate the current Ravenous builds.

hot,Jinx is my favourite champion and i think her passive change is not even good for jinx mains.,"I think it was a neat idea in theory, but i don't like it for 2 reasons:

1. I love Jinx for how straightforward, simple and fair she is. I bet next patch her passive will be changed to something like ""the attack speed part of her passive can stack on takedowns but only on champions not towers, except the first stack."" you convoluted on of the most fun yet simple passives in the game.
2. for normal non challenger players it's already a lot to ask to develope an intuition for jinx attack speed for 1. the minigun, 2. the rockes, 3. minigun with passive, 4. rockets with passive. Now there are so many different high attack speeds that normal people should just stand still and not kite because they will cancel too many autos to make it worth it. Old jinx with rockets and passive was the easiest, most noob friendly version of adc kiting and given that she is the face of league of legends to most people checking out the game i think that is a good thing. just buff her base numbers and revert her please.

hot,"If Seraphine Mains within all three of her roles are satisfied with her gameplay, why ship any changes at all?","I really don't see the point in the adjustments now that Riot are backtracking themselves on some of them. She's a viable carry pick, can have pro-play presence in the right conditions, and she fills a niche for players in Solo-Queue that is largely under represented in carry roles while also having that diet Mage-Enchanter gameplay that's popular at Support.

And since original changes were announced, and all three spheres of Supp, Bot, and Mid Sera players have reacted with large amounts of negativity on top of the community around them reacting negatively to the changes...

Why ship them at all? It's clearly something that both Mains and players do not want for the Champion. It's not to late too just leave it alone.

Lee-Sin was left alone after intended adjustments for him were received with backlash. Any assassin that would be getting this same treatment would likely be instantly catered to.

hot,What is the current community consensus on hullbreaker?,"Hullbreaker is currently breaking most elos and it needs to be addressed imo.

Nobody likes facing hullbreaker, nobody likes playing with hullbreaker. Even the people who are abusing it probably don’t like it and would split anyway. It is the most game defining item in the entire roster, more so than any mythic could even dream of being. It promotes a boring, toxic, and shallow play style for all 10 players and requires the enemy team to play much much better than the hullbreaker team to stand a chance. 

You can argue all the points for (gives toplane agency, reward for weakside) or against (ridiculous gold efficiency, ridiculous winrates, toxic playstyle) but it doesn’t matter. It absolutely destroys the league experience for everyone involved.

This got 10 times worse with the snowball reductions so it is so much harder to punish. Interested to read some other opinions because as a bot side player it feels impossible to win if enemy toplaner wins and builds that item.",jaimery,1697459795.0,0,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1794zbc/what_is_the_current_community_consensus_on/
hot,PSA: Worlds starts 4 hours earlier tomorrow,"Final day of playins starts 4 hours earlier, not really sure why they decided to make the change because I don't see who it benefits in the first place.

It changes nothing for Korea since it's a Sunday, it changes nothing for EU fans because the series would have been at a better time without the time change(for BDS specifically).

Edit = someone pointed out it's most likely due to best of 5s since it would add in at least 2 extra games even if it's two 3-0's compared to two 2-0s.

hot,"""In Houses"" Idea","Hey guys!

I'm here in peace! I'm in a LoL team right now, and I'm having a conversation with my mid laner about trying to play more Ranked so he would play (theorically) better players and improve much more, than just ARAM and scrims once or twice a week. And this got me thinking, ranked anxiety is a thing very popular, and people actually prefer not to play the game, even tho they want to get better, and there is no real competitive way to do it. LP gains and losses affects everyone, and there's people who don't really deal well with that, so I came up with an idea, that I believe might already exist. What if we use the LoL official discord to create a ladder there. The idea is, people can have decent games, with comms, and the rank is measured in the server, with wins and losses. It doesn't influence LoL ranked at all, but it's a place for people that might prefer to have a proper ""competitive 5v5"" approach, rather than going solo, with no comms, without knowing anything about your mates. 

Is this a good idea? I'd like to know your guys opinion on this. 

Thanks",TiagoSacra,1697410341.0,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178rf3z/in_houses_idea/
hot,Do I fundamentally not understand botlane?,"I am plat adc playing for 1.5 years, mostly Kai'sa, (so i guess gold from every other year) I know im not great, just enjoy playing mobas.

My understanding of the lane is that it is the supports job to enable allies to get gold and contribute with low econ to the team with vision and cc or buffs.  

I tend to get annoyed when i get a support like swain who i feel is usually playing for themself trying to carry the game and mostly relies on the opposing lane playing poorly getting caught in his really slow cc.

I get told i have main character syndrome, and yes I feel that the best way to win usually is to play through bot and dragon stack, but i dont expect mid and jgl to help my lane a ton every game and understand jgl weaksiding me and play my best and only mention if they harass me about performance.  But I don't understand queuing as support and not playing with the goal of enabling your adc/team and playing for yourself.

Am I right to be annoyed at a support playing for themself, or is it my job to try and be an enabler for them?

It would be nice for fiora to be tagged in all emotes with her and same thing with every character so you can quick switch your emotes based on the game and character you play and I feel like would make it a lot easier to have the emotes you want for the game.

hot,Pestin The Plague Conjuror (Champion Concept),"Resource: Pestin is in possession of an ever-refilling reservoir of a mysterious liquid. They use this liquid to cast spells. (2000 resource, doesn't scale per level) (Regenerates 100/s)

Attack Range: Melee (swipes with their overgrown nails)

**Passive** (**Sadism**): Pestin is drawn to those who are close to death, their autoattacks do **10% max health magic damage** to those under 50% health. **Cooldown: 10 seconds per target**

**Q Ability: Infected Spear** (**750-500 resource**) - Pestin throws an infected spear doing **70-210 (+110% bonus AP) Magic Damage**, pierces enemies. Does 60% reduced damage to targets beyond the first.

**W Ability: Specter** (**400-200 Resource**) - Pestin conjurors a spirit for **5.25 seconds**, during this time- any ability cast by Pestin will be copied by the Spirit for 100% damage. If Pestin and the Spirit both land an ability on the same enemy Champion, Pestin restores 300-500 of their Resource. Recasting this ability will swap Pestin and the Specter's places. **Cooldown: 20 - 17 seconds**

**E Ability: Toxic Aura (400 Resource)** \- Active: Pestin releases a burst of toxic gas from the Reservoir, dealing 65-145 (+65% bonus AP) magic damage. Specter's copy of this ability slows enemies by (20-40%) for 1.5s. Landing Toxic Aura on an enemy champion will reduce the cooldown of Specter by 2 seconds per champion hit. **Cooldown: 5-3 seconds**

**R Ability: Autopsy (No Cost)**\- Pestin drinks from the Reservoir, becoming empowered from its effects. Pestin spawns a Specter where they are, then leaps untargetably to a targeted enemy champion, marking them for 3 seconds. The mark stores pre-mitigation damage done to the marked enemy, releasing (25% / 40% / 55%) of it as Magic Damage after the mark expires. Does 65% AP (+stored damage) magic damage. Recasting this ability will swap Pestin and the Specter's place. **Cooldown: 120/100/80s**

I lied, this is Zed's kit. Does this really sound like the kit of a ""Melee Assassin"" to you? Except for the passive doing magic damage, swap all other ""magic damage"" to ""physical damage"" and all scaling to physical damage. Literally copied straight from Zed's kit.

Zed is not an Assassin, he plays more like an AD Caster than anything.

Fizz has to get right next to you to do damage.

Naafiri has to get right next to you to do damage.

LeBlanc has to get right next to you to do damage.

Yone, Yasuo, Talon, all of these assassins have to be right next to you to do insane damage.

Not Zed though. The honest to god combo is to use Ultimate, then INSTANTLY before they become targetable ult away, throw W and then hit you with 3 Ranged E + Qs. Never once being in danger of you hitting them. That's how Ryze plays not an AD Assassin with the most versatile items in the game.",CareElectrical1505,1697398148.0,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178my8z/pestin_the_plague_conjuror_champion_concept/
hot,The Great Resurrection - A Coven (short) Story,"Hey Everyone!

I wanted to do a fun fan-made short story for the Coven/Eclipse Universe as it's my favourite skin line. When I first saw the ASol art for SunEater/Eclipse Knight in LoR and the coven skins that came out recently on LoR and LoL, it inspired me to come up with this story you're about to read. I hope some (or all) of you enjoy the read. Again, it's meant to be short and sweet, and hopefully, the actual Coven &amp; Eclipse Knights story gets explored some more in the future along with some more skins!

# The Great Resurrection - A Coven (short) Story

The Great Resurrection had been halted for too long. The Coven of the South, led by Evelynn, was busy fighting against Sivir and her Eclipse Knights. The Coven of the West, led by Queen Morgana, was engaged in dealing with the Sun-Eater Kayle’s awakening. The Coven of the East, led by Syndra, was dealing with two unexpected problems: Nami and Janna’s disappearance and Nilah's betrayal. The Great War continued to rage on, and the support from the witches' old gods remained scarce because the slumbering God Queen did not create enough of them before she was sealed away in the Forgotten Temple.

Now, there are whispers of the Eclipse Knights close to summoning their great deity, the Sun-Eater Aurelion Sol, to bring an end to the witches and old gods in this final last stand. Thus, it was up to the Coven of the North, led by Illaoi and the God Queens prophet, who entrusted her to carry her “eye” to resurrect her and turn the tides of this great war.

The Forgotten Temple was a hidden structure located on top of Mount Aveth where the texts of the Great Resurrection and Witchcraft were first transcribed, along with it being the prison of the first Old God, the God Queen Bel’Veth—creator of all her Old God spawns and Mother to all Witches that harness her primordial magic.

With no word from the other Covens and permission from Queen Morgana, Illaoi, Gwen, Karma, and Neeko set out to accomplish Bel’Veth’s greatest task before the Eclipse Knights and their Sun Eater God arrived.

Upon entering the temple, the walls were engraved with ancient spells they’d never heard of before and primordial magic resonated out of each of them. Neeko attempted to place her hand on one of the scribes, but the touch magically burned her mind until Karma pulled her back to reality. As powerful as the four of them may be, this magic was beyond their comprehension, even for the likes of Neeko.

Up ahead was a statue of Bel’Veth in her human form, sitting on a throne heavily guarded by eclectic, powerful enchantments from chains, runes and an impenetrable barrier. Well, at least not in Illaois eyes. As Illaoi held the eye of her god in front of her, it began to glow. Within moments, four giant spiritual vines manifested and wrapped themselves around the barrier, slowly constricting it until cracks started to appear. Then, without hesitation, all four of the vine tentacles combined into one and came crashing down upon the barrier, shattering it and causing it to dissipate.

It was Karma's turn next to handle the runes, but it wasn’t as simple as waving her hands and hand gesturing them away. Each rune had to be dispelled individually, but as intuitive and powerful as she was, she could find the flaws in every enchantment she encountered. With a focused resolve and a short window of time, she tethered one rune to the others and collapsed them all at once.

The chains were next, an easy obstacle for Gwen to overcome, but with a snip and another snip of her giant enchanted scissors against them, they wouldn’t break. Illaoi tried her hand at the chains to break them with physical strength, but nothing worked. Gwen took a moment to ponder the chains until an idea struck.

She then hurled a needle at each of the chains' four corners and began to chant, channelling her powers through her giant scissors. Within moments, a dome of mist enveloped the statue and chains. She stepped into the mist and became ethereal. Holding her scissors to the chains again, she snipped it, and it immediately broke. She repeated this action on the other three until they all were gone. Stepping out of the vanishing dome of mist, she looked at Neeko as she was nervously standing beside Karma, awaiting her turn.

As confident as they were in Neeko and her great power, Neeko was still anxious about pulling off what was required of her next. But her sisters reassured her that she was doing this for all of their sisters who were hunted and killed, and she would be the final key in speaking the text of the Great Resurrection, engraved on Bel’Veths statue. Illaoi gave Neeko her idol. She nodded, and as she slowly walked up to the statue, her form shifted to that of Queen Morgana, the voice they needed to unlock the final enchantment that bound Bel’Veth. Illaois idol condensed into a smaller size, and Neeko placed their god's eye into the statue's forehead. As she began to speak the words, the others could sense the air becoming heavy and cold just from outside the tomb. Illaoi, Karma and Gwen went to uncover what it was.

Reaching the lobby of the Temple, to the right of them was a shattered oversized gold mirror. The pieces of glass on the ground suddenly pieced themselves together and reformed the mirror. It started to glow, and within moments, stepping out of the mirror was the Coven of the West: Lissandra, Camille, Zyra and Leblanc.

To the left of them, a claw-like slash through space appeared and savagely opening the tear wider emerged the Coven of the South: Evelynn, Cassiopeia, Ashe and Ahri. Soon after, a giant flock of black ravens crashed into the lobby grounds and revealed the Coven of the East: Syndra, Akali and Elise.

Illaoi and her Coven were pleased to see the rest of their sisters still alive and well, but the absence of Nilah, Nami and Janna piqued their curiosity. News of Nilah's betrayal and new allegiance to the Eclipse Knights was unfolded. Nami and Janna, however, had set off on their pilgrimage to seek greater power to help the witches in the Great War, and knowledge of their whereabouts continues to be clouded.

Pleasantries were cut short by the arrival of a dark owl that descended before them. Just as it landed and transformed, appearing amongst them was Queen Morgana. Displeased with how reckless the others have become and the secrets others have been keeping, her irritation flourished even more at the sound of her voice coming from deep within the hallway to Bel’Veth’s tomb.

Deep down, Morgana never wanted to follow through with the great resurrection and knew if Be’Veth returned, her title as Queen of all Covens would be relinquished, and she insisted on handling the war in her own way. She immediately took to her owl form and went through the catacombs to stop Neeko.

The moment she arrived and transformed back to her human form, she lashed out at Neeko with a blast of dark energy, but Neeko was quickly shielded against it by Karma who intervened. As the others suddenly arrived in the tomb, Morgana was seconds away from embracing her true form and dispatching all those who would try to stop her. But she was too late, and with the last bit of the ritual spoken, Neeko had succeeded. The statue quickly shattered, and with it, the resurrection of the God Queen Bel’Veth was complete.

Bel’Veth’s human form was benevolent to them all and magically adorned itself in garments. She was depicted as extremely beautiful, with long white hair, pale grey skin and glowing violet eyes. An elaborate black and gold-coloured gown manifested onto her body, and a crown formed on her head. Black and red ravens emerged from the magical walls one by one and collided with her back, creating a long cloak of feathers.

All the witches bowed before Bel’Veth, all of them except Morgana. Unfortunately, she addresses her God Queen so poorly, but Bel’Veth doesn’t think much of it as she relishes her return and the breath of life once more. Before words could be exchanged between the two queens, a loud sonic scream shook the temple, causing the pillars and ceiling to collapse. Karma quickly acted and shielded them all from the rubble.

But suddenly, a shower of stars fell from the night sky and collided with the shield, pressuring it to collapse, but Karma not once showed any signs of wavering. That was until a spark of moonlight fired into the temple and destroyed her shield. As the dust cleared, the witches headed for the entrance and upon reaching it, waiting at their doorstep stood the Eclipse Knights High Priestesses: Lux, Soraka and Seraphine.

The witches laughed amongst themselves as the three stood no match against them and the might of their God Queen Bel’Veth. But it soon became no laughing matter as their leaders, Leona and Diana, suddenly appeared with Aatrox, Senna, Sivir, Nilah, Sejuani, Fiora, Irelia, Rell, and the army of the Eclipse Knights waiting just at the bottom of the temple.

This would be the last stand for the witches; this time, they knew there was no more running, no more hiding and no more gods to call upon. Bel’Veth began to chuckle as her voice reverbed throughout her temple, and she soon began to ascend higher up into the sky as her body started to distort and change into her true form. The enormous and monstrous being floated above the temple and glanced down upon the puny Eclipse Knights that appeared as mere ants beneath her feet.

With her third eye,  she noticed in the distance a fierce storm making its way towards the temple and hidden within that storm were Janna and The Thousand Pierced Volibear at her side. As the armies of the Elderwood continued to cross the bridge of the murky waterways bordering the Elderwood to assist their fellow Eclipse Knight allies here, they were suddenly stopped by the emergence of Nami and her giant sea creature, the Leviathan.

Their armies were no match against Bel'Veth and her followers this time. They had come so far only to fail. But her attention was quickly drawn elsewhere as the Sun-Eater Kayle and, with her, the Sun-Eater Aurelion Sol were descending from the cosmic reaches of space. The end of the Great War had finally begun.

hot,"Right now, a diamond player cannot climb out of emerald","With how wide the skill gap is in emerald, where you have previous split gold 2 sometimes going against previous split d2/d1 players, if you are a diamond 4 or diamond 3 player, you cannot reliably and consistently carry emerald games. You can do well every game consistently. You can outperform your laner consistently. But a diamond 4 or 3 player, right now, does not have the skill to consistently carry emerald games. This is the **only** time this has been true. Previously, if you were a diamond 4 or 3 player in plat, you might struggle for a little bit, but you could consistently carry platinum players versus other platinum players. But in emerald, you are tasked with sometimes (or most times, if you're unfortunate) carrying gold players versus diamond players from previous splits. Right now, if you want the skill to be able to consistently climb out of emerald, you need to be playing **way** above a diamond 4 or 3 skill level. This isn't to say it's impossible to get out of emerald, but you will not get out by playing slightly above the average emerald skill level.  This is **not** a good way to measure your own skill.  In fact, if you're watching any challenger streamers right now doing some kind of ""unranked to challenger"", they shit stomp their way through gold/plat mmr, then when they hit emerald mmr, their winrate goes down to like 65%. Then when they hit diamond 2 or diamond 1 mmr, their winrate skyrockets again. **Challenger players** struggle to carry games in emerald. So, if you are only diamond 4 or 3, you **cannot** consistently carry enough games to climb out of emerald.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention LP gains. Even **if** you were to somehow play at a diamond 1-2 level to climb out of emerald as a diamond 4 or 3 player, it may **still** take you a hundred more games than it should because of how atrocious lp gains are in emerald right now.

All LCK teams minus T1 - heard there were some Faker shenanigans. 

LPL teams minus Weibo - no idea why, there's always that one team from the LPL that underperforms (I don't watch LPL it's just blind roll).

LEC - G2 only. I'd love to click FNC or BDS, but I don't feel like LEC is as strong as it was in 2017 or so. New FNC without Rekkles feel reckless.

LCS - historically all LCS teams suck beside C9 which field EMENES, so it's kind of a case of itself. NRG look very favored to me, but I have no hope for LCS due to their international performance and Golden Guardians fiasco I saw before play-ins.

hot,Normal matchmaking needs a rework,"Over the past 6 months I've been compiling all of my normal draft games. Over time I started seeing 2 distinct trends. Over 80% of all of my games consists of premade groups of at least 3 but more often 4-5. Roughly 60% of my games contains a player at least 2 entire tiers above my entire team. 

This has created an environment of complete one sided stomps. In the rarity that my team is the premade or the higher ranked player, my team then does the stomping. Even games are extremely rare.

At first I gave the benefit of the doubt for this situation. Maybe my MMR was high, maybe I was toxic and got in a group of other toxic players, maybe all this stems from the past when all my friends used to play together. The issue is, all that has been over with for a long time. I'm now back to honor 4 and have cut all the things I used to do to get restricted on this account. My friends stopped playing over a year ago and I've been solo since.

So my next thought was okay maybe our normal MMR just matches their normal MMR. That would make a lot of sense if I saw these plat/emerald/diamond players playing an off role or a champion they weren't used to. However, more often than not, not only is this not the case, but they are usually on one tricks or very high mastery champions.

Now for the interesting part. I made an alternate account specifically to one trick a champion for ranked without having all the ranked anxiety on my main account. The result? Games like league used to be. Back and forth leads with interesting fights and a lot of skirmishes. No one sided stomps or toxic one tricks that are 1/2/3 tiers higher than our team. Everyone genuinely working together to win. All the 5 man cheese coming out of a random bush is gone. No more breathing in the jungle and 17 people showing up.

I've put a lot of games in over the past 6 months and no matter what I do, it shows no sign of improving. This leads me to believe my main account has some sort of flag or issue with it to cause this kind of setting.

Is anyone else getting the same circumstance? If so how widespread is this problem? It's frustrating as a silver player to queue up and get a 5 stack with 2 plat+ one tricks on it absolutely wiping the floor with me and my team. What can be done to fix this if it is a widespread issue?

hot,suggestion: a better ranked reward system that could reduce ranked solo Q's toxicity and make ranked a more exciting and less stressful mode to play,"picture this: its 2 days to the end of the split and you que for a solo q game to grind towards your goal since you dont have much time left, you get into a game, everyone is stressed out a bit due to various reasons and you know its going to be a hard game; game starts and the enemy invades and your adc dies and right then and there the game is over, why? because your adc is fully tilted and decides everyone should lose

awesome isnt it? yeh... its not

&amp;#x200B;

so why does this happen? the majority of the people know that they will never become a pro player and not everyone wants to make a career out of this game either; so this leaves out a handful of reasons that contributes to the stressful environment of ranked **with one of them being the ranked rewards**

&amp;#x200B;

ranked rewards are currently timegated and riot is reducing the time you have to grind ranked to get the skin + **the chromas that show your achieved rank** in the next split which is going to potentially increase the stress of climbing

&amp;#x200B;

**basically: you don't get your rank = you miss out on content that you might have a high interest in getting it** which leads to toxicity and it usually gets worse around the end of each split which I'm sure most people have experienced it!

&amp;#x200B;

ENTER RANKED TOKENS!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ly6di4znfub1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb2d83734c3f334ec24f17b769b4434023a88e2

what are ranked tokens? they are currency that you get at the end of each split instead of a victorious skin! they resemble the rank that you finished the split in with different colors and can be used to redeem a victorious skin OR a chroma collection of YOUR CHOICE (and if you pick the newest victorious skin it comes bundled with the chromas as well)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s1fad313ofub1.png?width=3180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e919798eec10be9ba4bdbd6f20814da2fdfb66a

the chroma bundle will get you all the chromas (both solo q and flex for previous victorious skins) up to your tokens color so even if you don't get the desired rank you can still try and climb to get that chroma of your choice, and if you want to get the rest you have to grind again to get higher and spend another token

&amp;#x200B;

with such a system everyone will have a good reason to climb now, sure the people that used to just play to get the skin will continue to do so but the rest of the community now has a incentive to try (just a tiny little harder) to get something that they might have missed due to various reasons and it will not timegate content that most can enjoy using!

&amp;#x200B;

you missed out on a sejuani chroma because of x but now you have the time to grind? well guess what you now have the opportunity to do so!

&amp;#x200B;

with such a system the community isn't **rushed** to climb which CAN lower the toxicity overall AND around certain times of the year and with the addition of 3 splits next year I think such a system would be way better than make the game a timesink where if you don't play it due to whatever reason you will miss out on a skin (potentially for your onetrick!) which feels aweful",51934659238,1697405129.0,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/178pill/suggestion_a_better_ranked_reward_system_that/
hot,Briar in ARAM is a bit absurd?,"Anybody piloting this champion with both hands can take over the entire game.

She has three modifiers in ARAM, including +5% damage dealt, -5% damage taken, and **+30%** (????) healing. This is compounded by her passive which increases healing by up to 50% based on missing health, and further boosted by Spirit Visage or revitalise.

 I understand that the majority of players will kill themselves due to berserk, but later in the game unless your team has infinite CC to stop her W and enough burst to kill her in between E's (both of which heal her for a ridiculous amount) it becomes comically difficult for her to die so long as she's pressing buttons in the general direction of the enemy team.

hot,Turbo/Wild Rift-Like Mode,"I'm just throwing this post out to the wind and hoping for the best.

Besides the toxicity, one thing I tend to see people say regarding why they don't play League is that matches are too long. And with the upcoming preseason changes, I'm worried the average match length will get even longer.

Let me get this out of the way: Yes, Wild Rift exists and it has 15-20 minute matches. But it's a mobile game and people might not like playing games on their phones or they simply don't have a powerful enough one to run the game. Plus, WR doesn't have every champ and skin that PC does.

So as a very casual player of PvP games, all I want is a permanent non-gimmicky (so not like URF) mode like DotA 2's Turbo mode, TFT's Hyper Roll or Valorant's Swift Play. Just the base game mode, but much faster. With this existing, people who want the regular mode to be longer and slower could get what they want, right?

top,I love the LCS~~,"Before worlds starts and several(or all) LCS teams crash out and burn. I'd just like to say I love my region a lot :D

This region has brought be happiness and joy throughout the years watching it(I've watched since 2019, have only seen one LCS make it past group stage). I try not to focus too hard on the international results, but domestically LCS is arguably one of the most competitive regions out there. Don't get me wrong, C9 tends to steamroll LCS, but out of 8 splits, we have seen 5 different champions!!! I'm sure LPL has had more but I really like how ""diverse"" our region is domestically!!!

I also really like some of the players like Spica and Dhokla, and for those that don't follow LCS too deeply on twitter, the community is really awesome. Though people are now afraid or too disappointed in the LCS to show their love anymore (valid reason), the community on twitter shows so much love to the players it's really wholesome there often.

I'm not saying that LCS will win worlds anytime soon, but I legitimately like our status at worlds. We are clearly not bottom of the barrel region, and at our best(which to be fair we don't show often lol) we can take down T1, like EG did in 2022!!!(I'm sure many people forgot)

top,"Phreak on Seraphine changes: ""if this is neutral on winrate this is a midlane-skewed buff and an APC nerf."" ""More of her power will be in her solo lane,"" and W changes are ""the only real nerf to the kit.""","In his [most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spXs6ufs3Kk) Phreak explained his rationale behind the Seraphine changes and why they're not a death knell for Seraphine mains. I've transcribed some of the video and emphasized some key lines.

## Disparity between roles:
[38:18] 
&gt; [Mid and support] winrates are 0.1% apart—they are the exact same power level and despite having the exact same power level, support Seraphine pickrate is **sixteen times** midlane Seraphine pickrate.  

&gt; We can't really in good conscience buff a  53% winrate champion who's got a respectable pickrate, especially in high ELO where players optimize for winrate and thus pick a really, really high winrate AP champion. **I think bot lane carry Seraphine can be 51, 52%, that's fine.**

 [40:25] 
&gt; We decided to say ""okay, let's bring botlane Seraphine (who's way up here)...and support Seraphine is down here and let's bring their power levels together; let's have bot Seraphine and support Seraphine have roughly the same power level; that would be nice."" And as a side goal, if we can make Seraph midlaner better, that's nice, but it's also so incredibly unpopular: it has less that half the pickrate of *jungle Teemo*, for example—its pickrate is near-identical to that of Zyra jungle, and Zyra jungle is a 46% winrate jungler.

&gt; There's just not that much of a market for Seraphine mid, and so in terms of serving the sixteen times the number of players who clearly want to play Seraphine support and the 1/16th that number of players who don't play Seraphine mid, we say we're going to serve the sixteen times more players, and we have to compensate botlane.

[55:35] 
&gt; It's also worth noting that the entire suite of changes is *midlane* skewed; if this is in sum total neutral on winrate, this is a midlane-skewed buff and a botlane APC-skewed nerf.
&gt; ... if less of her power is in the absolutely absurd levels of healing from her W, this means more of her power is in her solo lane self-reliant power budget such as my shield is stronger/has a lower cooldown and my Q does more damage on a lower cooldown, so [the W changes are] midlane skewed, or rather a nerf to everything *but* midlane. Now, of course, teamfight output is of course weaker, to be fair; W2 is very clearly the best spell to echo. It's not even close; this skill is so overpowered, this is where basically all her power is.

&gt; **Our internal read on winrate magnitude is that this overall set of changes that we're still going through is about 0.5% winrate positive to botlane Seraphine and about 3% winrate positive to support Seraphine.** I'm a little skeptical, because I think [the W] nerf is very, very, very, very large, and I'm kind of relying on it to eat the entire power budget of everything else going on in this changelist because everything else is power-positive, and it's like, okay, this is the only line of a real nerf in the kit.

 [1:00:40] 
&gt; What's the overall result going to be for this champion? It's hard to say. **I think very strongly that support Seraphine is going to be quite a bit better; I think bot Seraphine will roughly tread water. I actually have reason to believe that mid Seraphine will gain winrate right here**; I think she will gain less than support Seraphine gains because the Q is so aggressively skewed towards support builds and not as aggressively good for AP builds, but there is definitely a chance that Seraphine is just busted next patch, and of course there also is the chance to get the numbers wrong and she sucks. And if she sucks, we buff the champion, but **the primary goal is to basically lower the gap between bot Seraphine and support Seraphine because we're not allowed to buff Seraphine in any role because bot Seraphine is too OP**. So we play up her level scaling, we play down her gold scaling, we play up her enchanter tendencies, we play down a little bit her group tendencies, and maybe we get to close the gap between botlane and mid and support, and that would be great because ti would be great to have her viable at all three roles.  
&gt; It's been a pipe dream so far; we've always been constrained by mid Seraphine being OP and support Seraphine sucked and then bot Seraphine's OP and support Seraphine sucked, and now it would be nice if we got all three. I'm not holding my breath, but that's the goal.

## Q changes:

 [47:11] 
&gt; Q is getting a shorter cooldown ranks one through four; it is getting more base damage ranks two through five and a better AP ratio at rank one, the same AP ratio at rank two, and a worse ratio rank three, four, and five. Now, remember what I said earlier about games ending on average with enough gold for three items.  
...Master Seraphine gets 6.5% less gold across their game than silver Seraphine botlane, which is to say it's much more likely that low elo Seraphine actually finishes three items than masters+ Seraphine finishes three items.  
...The rational thought is that Q is strictly stronger at rank one, strictly stronger at rank two, strictly stronger at rank three, strictly stronger at rank four, and then stronger at rank five from minutes nine through twenty-seven, until you finish Seraph's Embrace. **Do not let anyone tell you the Seraphine changes are a nerf because they are not, they pretty much can't be.** There is a part of time where the spell is weaker that is paid for by the first 25 minutes being stronger and that means that by her being stronger at winning 1v1s and getting lane priority and winning teamfights and securing objectives and killing turrets pays for more ability power to further offset where she would be weaker in a real game, the acute changes are a strict buff to Seraphine.  
...**Q is strictly buffed; it is more buffed for support than for a farm lane, but it is overall buffed for the champion, no ifs ands or buts. Q change is a strict buff to Seraphine. If this was the only change, she would gain winrate in every single role she plays. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise; they're wrong.**

## W changes:

[53:14] 
&gt; By having the shield go up per rank and the cooldown go down per rank and (though the rank one ability mana cost goes up) the mana cost per rank goes down, there are three levers here that all say maxing W is better than it was before. It's worth noting that, again, because support Seraphine does not get a lot of ability power, maxing Q is also better than before, so we'll see which way they go, but it is going to be a lot of power to support Seraphine in both of those cases. 
&gt; ...I'm believing pretty strongly we should never get anywhere close to Sona's level of cooldown. Spamming W on a short cooldown feels more like Sona's sort of thing and so leaving this a as a relatively long cooldown because it does shield your entire team and can be doublecasted for minimum 300 shield to your team *before* AP ratio—that's a lot of power, that's a way shorter cooldown, and actually more shielding than Karma E, so we have to be pretty respectful here. This can get way too powerful way too fast.
&gt; The final change to W as compensation is a pretty significant nerf to the heal of a repeat-cast W, so not only is the base heal going down by 2% missing health at all ranks, but also the AP ratio is going away entirely; there is no longer an AP ratio on the W.

## E changes:

 [59:16] 
&gt; The [E changes] are strictly midlane buffs; E cost per rank goes down from ten per rank to five per rank, and the E damage is [...] a meaningful damage increase at max rank: +60 max rank, so it's fifteen damage per rank up. So if you get to that lategame mid Seraphine scenario where you finally have more ability power, you finally finish the third item even though the game ended the moment you finish the third item, congratulations, E does more damage now and makes up for your damage in front of Q. So again, she's just a stronger mage than before. The up-to-60 extra damage on E (of course that is very late in the game and often not reached) but even the +15 at level 14 is easily reached [...] this is basically a freebie midlane lever to say ""hey, her level scaling is probably going to be a bit better now."" It's much harder for bot and support Seraphine to get the later levels.",HeirToGallifrey,1697643679.0,829,367,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17atrth/phreak_on_seraphine_changes_if_this_is_neutral_on/

teams take the two 3-0 slots and the three 3-1 slots and qualify. We'll give Western teams a bit of a break and let GAM get knocked out 0-3 or 1-3 along with four Western teams. This leaves
three Western and three Eastern teams at 2-2. If any Western teams draw each other (about 60%) one is guaranteed top 8. In the other case, East vs West, East vs West and East vs West, some of the best Western teams at the tournament get three opportunities to
beat some of the weaker Eastern teams at the tournament. We'll be pessimistic and say each Western team only has  around a 15% chance of winning their bo3 at 2-2 against the Eastern team. That's still  ~40% (1-0.85^3) for any Western team to win their match-up.

**Finding NRG Palafox's Genius in his KR Solo Queue Data**

Tomorrow (19th October 2023) the LCS Champions, NRG, face the LPL 4th seed, Weibo Gaming, in the first round of the League of Legends World Championship.

It’s far too easy to be an NA doomist, I mean, given their record and all. However, sometimes, all you need is a little hope. Today that hope has come in the form of an off-hand comment by XiaoHu, the Wiebo mid-laner, who described Palafox, his opposite number in NRG, as “powerful, and seems like a genius”.

Yes, this was later more accurately translated to be closer to “talented with potential”, but, as I say: today is all about spreading the hopium.

Now, I won’t be jumping immediately to “and so NRG will probably win Worlds”. Instead, I’m simply going to try and fuel the fire. My fuel, in this case, is a s##t tonne of Korean Solo Queue data, alongside a desire to answer a very simple question; what makes Palafox a genius?

Before we get into the detail, here’s a quick explanation of the data.

**Data Preliminaries**

* All data comes from **Korean Solo Queue**.
* A special thank you to [TrackingThePros](https://www.trackingthepros.com/) who provide me with the solo queue account names.
* I am writing this on the **18th October**, the data on the site below refreshes regularly and so will therefore not match exactly.
* Statistics are calculated from the players last **50 games**, to be best reflective of their current elo.
* All statistics are **adjusted by the players Champion pool**. They are therefore reflective of the player and how they perform above or below the average for their Champions.
* When quoting **percentiles**, they are being **compared** to all **Master+ accounts**, not just other professional players.
* **Kills/Deaths in the last 10 seconds of a game (fountain dives, mostly) are removed**, as to not punish regular for-fun fountain diving. Therefore, some games will not match **exactly** what is quoted in a player’s match history.
* You can see all data here: [iTero Korean Solo Queue Statistics](https://www.itero.gg/pro-statistics)

Now, on with the question. What makes Palafox a genius?

I have over 500 statistics to deal with, but to start let us keep it simple. He currently sits at a respectable 766LP, from an impressive 441 games. This puts him ahead of his lane opponent, but admittedly he’s had a few more games to get there.

[LP and Games in KR Solo Queue 2023](https://preview.redd.it/kbioqcd2dzub1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b101d5dbc73ae1c2532b2f714d91815cd3e06b6)

His Champion Pool is also, by most comparisons, fairly normal. No sign of his genius just yet.

[Palafox's recent Champion Pool](https://preview.redd.it/cabxdf7bdzub1.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31fc5403df56d8c13683200cc9fdea9e3156f5f3)

Having spent the last hour studying his Solo Queue data in an almost stalkerish level of detail, there was one theme that stood out among all others.

**Palafox is the KDA King.**

[ Overall KDA](https://preview.redd.it/i8ye5jfedzub1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55df5f6430152fb5acfda7159456689ca91b824f)

(Remember, all stats are adjusted by the Champion Pool. His “raw” average is lower, but he constantly over-performs on KDA when compared to other high ranked players who play similar Champions!)

There were several components that make-up his overall KDA that stood-out to me:

* KDA against his Lane Opponent
* KDA in the Jungle/River (and the impact on objective control)
* KD in Solo Bolos

## KDA against his Lane Opponent

[Kills + Assists on Mid-Laners](https://preview.redd.it/auej9nihdzub1.png?width=497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61249e5ec9295fa803452b40f3af9272e6780d0e)

Let’s start with his Kills + Assists against mid-laners. Although he’s in the bottom third of the elo (since solo queue mavericks tend to play riskier than pros), he remains competitive with more comparable opponents like G2 Caps and XiaoHu - Faker being an outlier for his passiveness in lane.

His genius, however, may best be seen when you use the above in conjunction with his Deaths to mid-laners.

[Deaths to Mid-Laners](https://preview.redd.it/090jpn5ldzub1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce29ff3f7663a7f73c2b3beda5e29093594882e0)

XiaoHu is killing mid-laners at a rate of 3.3 a game, but dying to them at the exact same rate, whilst Caps is even dying more than he kills them! Palafox manages to get 3.4 kills or assists a game on his fellow mid-laners, whilst only dying to them 2.3 times. A master class in controlled aggression.

**KDA in the Jungle &amp; River**

The second component is his KDA specifically whilst inside the jungle and river. Usually these happen during team fights and skirmishes around key objectives like Heralds and Dragons.

[KDA in the Jungle + River](https://preview.redd.it/054bdd0odzub1.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40776538c72759ba162891df05a5f565f57dc65c)

For this one, I use a slightly different statistic than normal. Rather than looking at a KDA Ratio, I instead add up all his Kills + Assists in the Jungle, and take away his Deaths.

The conclusion is really self-explanatory; Palafox seems to just be better than XiaoHu at team fights in the jungle. I really can’t be budged on this conclusion, sorry.

You may also be wondering; given his absolute dominance in jungle team fighting, do his teams tend to secure more Dragons and Heralds:

[Net Dragons &amp; Net Barons](https://preview.redd.it/6v0mohz0ezub1.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebd0612340b191ecd96759c23e2fa47c7c8b2443)

Again, I use a slightly different metric here. Rather than looking at the raw amount of Monsters killed, I look at the net value. If your team takes it, you get +1, if the enemy takes it you get -1, and if no one took it you get 0.

*Data Note: I include Dragons/Heralds that the player did not directly assist with, since there are plenty of ways of helping your team secure an objective without needing to be directly involved.*

With Palafox’s exceptional jungle team fighting he is able to help his team secure Dragons and Heralds far above the average, and certainly above XiaoHu!

**Solo-Bolo KD Differential**

As our final statistic, let us now look at how many Solo-Bolos he averages per game, and how that compares to his Solo-Bolo deaths.

[Solo Bolos KDs](https://preview.redd.it/7hktw6k3ezub1.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c3ae835a279ac1419b06be940a61af471b21c7)

If you look closely at the table, you can quite quickly see that NRG are going to beat Weibo tomorrow. At this point, it’s a mathematical fact. XiaoHu is only managing 1.39 Solo Kills a game but is getting Solo Killed 1.27 times? Our boy Palafox not only manages to get MORE Solo Kills (1.48), he’s also doing it whilst being Solo Killed considerably less (0.81)!

**To Conclude**

Through my research and writing of this brief Solo Queue analysis I have become increasingly confident that NRG will be beating Weibo tomorrow. This will come almost exclusively through an absolute monstrous mid-gap. Which will unfold a little like this:

* XiaoHu, in a desperate attempt to show his prowess will make a number of failed plays against Palafox, who will happily take the free Kill (or Assist), whilst safely farming his lane.
* Around the 8-10 minute mark, both teams will collapse around Herald where NRG will emerge victorious after an almost flawless team fight from their mid-laner.\*huffs the last tin of copium\*
* Although NRG are ahead at this point, it’s not until a monstrous Solo Bolo from Palafox onto XiaoHu and the subsequent Baron does the game become a complete one-sided stomp, followed by a 27-minute final push.

*All statistics in this article are true and factual as of 18th October, the additional commentary may contain traces of /s.*

**Jungle Followup**: Jungle followup isn't listed here, but we plan on returning the AD ratio to the pet and adjusting some of the healing values. Our short term plans are to get the within role balance back so the different classes (and the champions within them) are each viable again. 

**Bel'Veth**: We're trying to buff E a bit, especially now that it's worse at early ranks without further encouraging a few points Q -&gt; E max. 

**Hecarim**: Hec was disproportionately hit by the blue pet changes, we're adding some baseAD back to get him more onto Sheen builds rather than lethality

**K'Sante**: Lots of bugfixes for K'Sante, increasing damage in all out form and lowering cast time on Q with HP purchases

**Le'Blanc**: Buffs to W as her bread and butter spell and E as the spell that has more gameplay

**Aurelion Sol**: Taking some amount of damage out of tap Q's and moving more towards the burst Q's in addition to moving some damage out of level scaling and into rank scaling

**Briar**: We're a bit of power out of her statcheck (she should still be good at it), while retaining lane Briar being reasonably powerful

**Cait**: Discussed Cait yesterday, but we think Lethality Cait shouldn't be her most powerful build

**Jinx**: This change should allow Jinx's passive to still result in those ""unleashed moments"", while capping some of the high end cases that seem a bit much

**Rammus**: Taking his damage down a bunch through both W converting to resists and early Q damage. With the pet resist synergies, this should also reduce clear time by some amount

**Brand/Zyra**: Some small adjustments to get a few more mages and AP's into the jungle, not trying to displace their main roles

**Seraphine**: Through their pickrate, Seraphine players have expressed their desire to play her in the support position. This doesn't mean that we're making mid/bot seraphine dead, but trying to narrow the gap between them. 

**Hullbreaker**: We opted to pure nerf Hullbreaker, as it is degrading some side lane patterns a bit much; needing to buy Hullbreaker to match another Hullbreaker is not a particularly desirable pattern"" - https://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1714457786405548502

Interesting to see Ruler isn't no.1 for any of them after seeing that 80% of western analysts had Ruler as the best player in the world (often phrasing as its not close too). Also good to see Knight being 1st twice, and 2nd once after seeing many people putting knight as the 3rd best mid or as low as 5th 6th player overall.

I like this list cause it seems they are actually kinda actually basing it off performance this year (except the obvious doinb Crisp bias). Often when you ask pro players like the 10 best players, they either barely watch games from all major regions or they base it off scrims or who they like more (I'm looking at you Evi having apamen as a your top 5 top laner at Worlds).",katareky,1697634640.0,379,249,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17aqg9r/doinb_zoom_and_cn_caster_miles_worlds_top_10/

I think EN translations are delayed until next week but here are some highlights:

4:30 - DK players submitting Worlds pick'em

* Canyon: ""who will get the most penta kills... who did you guys pick?""
* Showmaker: ""I picked Deft, we have to give him a penta"" (Deft never got a penta in his entire LCK or Worlds career)
* Deft: ""wow if I get a penta at Worlds...""
* Canyon: ""But I picked Ruler...""
* Showmaker: ""Ah sh-...."" (to Deft) ""He said he picked Ruler, really? We could even run into JDG...!""
* Deft: ""OK well I'm voting for Kanavi now!""

5:40 - question is ""did you ever think there was a chance you would not qualify for Worlds?""

* Deft: ""When Summer Split ended we were in a really worrying situation, but Playoffs scrims went really well so after that I felt like we would make Worlds 100%""
* Kellin: ""Yeah we overcame a lot of issues during playoffs and now **Worlds scrims are also going super well**""
* Deft: ""I feel like we got a lot ""closer"" during in game comms later in the season. IRL we were always pretty friendly from the start but it took some time to get that same closeness in game, for example if a teammate makes a mistake, they aren't so worried now about how other teammates might react in game""

8:25 - excerpts of in game comms during scrims

* Kellin: ""Canna don't worry, bot lane is over, we're good""
* Showmaker: ""\[Canna\] if you can just group and be a warm body we can win""
* Canna: ""I'm not sure if I can even do that lol""
* Showmaker: ""Yes you can LOL... our top wave state does make me want to quit the game though""
* (I think eventually enemy team FF'ed the scrim)

18:18 - question is ""how is the team spirit now?""

* Showmaker: ""After Regional Finals the team morale has been really good. I would say, Worlds is a really fun experience - compared to LCK there's a lot more nerves and a lot more at stake. We've all been to Worlds before, and in order to reproduce \[for Canyon/Deft/SM\] that amazing feeling when you win Worlds, everyone is giving extra effort and I think that's contributing to the team spirit.""
* Canna: ""I think our team synergy has improved a lot, like we're better at matching each other's picks and creating a cohesive team comp now""
* Canyon: ""We've been playing together for like 8 months now, so I think our teamwork is really good at this point""

Its a free deployed build and quite rushed. It started off as a simple console script that I probably shouldn't have made into a web-app but here we are. Please ignore any defects and it surely could have had more features but for now it has two modes to play.

1. Randomize Results:
   1. Randomize (East Biased): In this mode the next round is generated but East always wins vs West and G2 always wins vs West.
   2. Randomize (Completely Random): Complete Chaos
2. PickEm': At any round, you are free to click and select on the outcomes for matches and ""LOCK IN"" after you select your picks.

top,Nofe’s Worlds 2023 Swiss Stage Meta Predictions,"Just something to read before Worlds 2023 swiss stage starts. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fen_ihkqdPA) 

Nofe was a former league coach, and is currently an LCK caster. This is a quick review of the 2023 Worlds Play-ins meta, alongside a prediction of how the meta will shift during the Swiss stage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Translation**

As always, I’m going to focus on drafts and meta instead of hyperfocusing on individual teams. So my goal is to guess the swiss stage meta by taking a look at what worked well in playins.  

If you look at how metas shifted during various stages of previous Worlds, there is a very obvious trend.  Obviously, play-in teams have a much lower level of play - and this is reflected in their drafts. These teams tend to draft with a focus on teamfights. In the later stages of the tournament, the stronger teams are much more lane focused. And this isn’t just a matter of preference. In the play-in stage, teamfight–focused comps tend to have a much higher winrate.  

This pattern held in this years playins. Despite all the speculation about how the Worlds patch would play out, the play-in stage meta was all about teamfighting. That being said, the meta will probably change drastically once the swiss stage begins. Just like how previous metas shifted drastically during the group stage. The best Asian teams are very good at snowballing off of lane advantages, which is the reason why lower tier teams have such a hard time pulling off upsets. Anyways, the swiss stage meta will probably be completely different from the playin stage meta, and my predictions are attempting to account for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TOP** 

 Keeping that in mind, let’s take a look at which champions had priority during playins. Starting with top. There were 2 picks that stood out – K'sante and Renekton. Renekton’s MR nerfs compounded with the statikk shiv nerfs made it look like split pushers like GP, Gnar and Gwen would dominate the meta, but these champions didn’t manage to make it onto the stage. Defying expectations, K’sante and Renekton held strong. When teams were forced to blind pick top, most teams chose to pick Renekton. These teamfight powerhouses were popular, especially among weaker teams. Interestingly, K’sante fared very well in the head to head against Renekton. Renekton’s greatest strengths are his lane priority into his strong Herald fights, but K’sante neutralized these advantages very well. Rumble and Kennen were also strong picks into Renekton, especially when paired with Jayce Mid. I believe this AP top / Jayce mid pattern will carry on into the Swiss stage. If you look at the results, K’sante did much better than Renekton. Renekton was much weaker than previous patches, especially against AP tops. Oh, and Adam’s GODS were definitely interesting to watch. I’m not sure how well these picks will work out in the swiss stage against the strong asian top laners. They all play mean Gnars, and there’s also a slight chance that some Asian tops will counter with Fiora, reminiscent of former Worlds. Since this is a meta where junglers actually go top, it will be interesting to see how the Asian teams interpret GODS. 

So, what do I expect to see during the swiss stage? To begin with, I predict a lot of Kennens and Gnars. And maybe Gangplank depending on the player. I don’t want to get too deep into this, since it’ll take a long time to explain, but the top pool depends on the mid pool. With the popularity of Syndra and Orianna, ‘standing mages’ that have a hard time side laning, top lane champions with strong side laning abilites will naturally become much better. Champions like Jax. These champions and their lane counters will become much more prominent in the Swiss stage.

&amp;#x200B;

**JG** 

 Moving on to Jungle. If you look at solo queue statistics, Lee Sin, Nidalee and Jarvan look very powerful. But so far, this trend didn’t make it’s way into pro play. Maokai dominated. Of course, there’s a chance that this is due to the fact that playin teams prefer teamfighting champs. Taliyah was also a high priority pick. I thought about the JG picks for a very long time, and I’ve arrived at a conclusion. Which jungles will be meta? I’m sorry to say this, but I expect Maokai and Sejuani to be the most contested jungles. Syndra, Orianna, and Azir are going to me the mid meta champs - no question about that. These champions need a strong dependable frontline. Will top play this role? No. Jax and Gnar are going to be splitpushing. Which leads to the natural conclusion – we’re going to see tank jungles like Sejuani and Maokai. I expect lots of Maokai, Sejuani, Jarvan, and Vi. Maybe Nocturne to aid the splitpushing top, or even some Viegos. In other words, the champs we’ve seen all summer, with the addition of Jarvan. With Lee Sin, I’m not sure. Despite currently performing well in solo queue and scrims, Lee generally tends to do poorly on stage. Some LCK teams like T1 and DK who love snowballing might take the risk, and LPL teams like BLG might try as well. Lee Sin works well with Sylas Galio and Lissandra, which are all champions that Yagao excels at. 

 Oh, and slightly unrelated, but there has to be an LCK or LPL team that plays Taliyah all the time in scrims. The playin teams drafted heavily around Taliyah, especially BDS. Teams seem to place rate Taliyah very highly, which personally didn’t make much sense looking in from the outside. Taliyah does have swap value though, so some LCK and LPL teams might bust her out on stage.  

&amp;#x200B;

**MID** 

 Next, on to mid. Despite all of the nerfs, Azir is still a strong meta pick. With a strong skill set, good late game value and playmaking ability, Azir simply refuses to leave the pro meta. The skill set is one that pro players refuse to give up. Azir is just too good at parrying kill threats from champs like Rakan and Jarvan. And Azir’s late game value is strong too, melting tanks and poking. The champion is too perfect. Yone and Akali match well into Azir though, so expect to see a few of those. The Asian mids are all great at Yone and Akali. Their mere existence prevents blind pick Azir, which I expect to limit Azir’s impact on the meta post swiss stage.  

 This patch, Orianna and Syndra are insane. If you look at the data, both champs have high presence, and Syndra’s win rate is off the charts. Since stronger teams tend to put higher priority on laning, these champions will become even more important as time progresses. Expect to see more of these two, not less. I expect that all of you know about Showmaker’s Syndra, or Faker’s infamous Orianna shockwave. No matter who you look at, be it Bdd, Knight, Yagao, etc., all of the Korean/Chinese mid laners are extremely proficient at playing Orianna and Syndra. Not a single player is bad on these champs – maybe Xiaohu? But even Xiaohu was once famous for his mid mages. There are no weak players. Neeko is also a strong playmaking pick alongside ADCs like Kaisa, and I expect to see some Neekos, but her laning is not quite as strong as it once was. It really depends on the team and the players. Sylas/Akali/Yone will be utilized by teams focused on midgame, especially teams that prefer strong mid carries like Gen G and DK. There is a good chance that we see these champs. Sylas may have a hard time laning against AP mid mages, but he does have an advantage against team comps with powerful ults. Maokai, Sejuani, Gnar and GP all have strong ults, furthering the case for Sylas. Last but not least, Leblanc could see some minor play paired with Lee Sin. All in all, the mid meta is interesting because there are so many champions that could see fringe play. Even Galio and Lissandra could see some play. Tristana and Annie are not as strong anymore, I would prefer Jayce over Tristana.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bot** 

When you build a team comp, the choice of ADC is the most important thing to consider. The entire team composition is warped around the choice of ADC. In that sense, there are 2 champions that have very distinct flavors – Xayah and Kaisa. If your team has Xayah, the goal is to make the other team come into you. You want 2 things - a sturdy front line and long range. Xayah comps go hand in hand with mid mages and with long range mids. Azir, Jayce, Tristana. Force the enemy to engage, and let Xayah clean up. 

Kaisa is the polar opposite of Xayah. The entire teamfight revolves around how well you can focus fire a single priority target when Kaisa ults in. Kaisa loves champions like Yone, Ahri, and Neeko. Not that Kaisa can’t be used with, say Orianna, but if you want to make the most use out of Kaisa’s DPS, you need to draft a dive comp. 

 Ezreal, Aphelios and Zeri made their mark during playins. Looking at solo queue data, the best ADCs were champs like Ezreal, Ashe, Kalista and Jhin. All supportive ADCs, without a single hypercarry. The ADC carry meta was nonexistant. But in play-ins, the meta did a 180 and shifted towards hypercarry ADCs. But it’s impossible to tell how the meta will shift during the swiss stage. LCK and LPL teams can take a bot lane advantage and snowball the entire game off of that, so we could see a lot of Ezreal Karma, Kalista + @, Caitlyn + @, etc. If teams can manage to annihilate Kaisas and Xayahs during the laning phase, the ADC tier list can change drastically. So it’s really hard to predict what will be strong until we actualy see what happens on stage. And since ADCs are the backbone of team comps, drafts will be completely different depending on what ends up on top. 

 If it turns out that supportive ADCs like Ashe and Jhin are dominant, then teams will start playing around mid game comps. In this case, they’re going to have to find late game value somewhere else – which will probably result in a surge in popularity of powerful splitpushing top laners. So the Top meta depends on the ADC tier list. It’ll be fun to see what ends up on top. No one knows what’s going to be good. But if there’s one thing I’m certain of, it’s that utility supports are really *really* weak compared to previous seasons. So we’ll be seeing lots Nautilus, Rakan and Rell. This points towards Kalista being strong and Ezreal/Caitlyn being weak, but it’s hard to tell. Sivir isn’t bad, and teams with skilled support players might play Senna, since Senna funnels gold into supports. But I think that Kalista will be the staple meta ADC. If initiation supports are meta, then Kalista will be used to both compliment them and to have a strong laning phase. Kalista is good at transfering bot lane dominace into the upper half of the map. And she pairs off with mid mages very well. And people have this perception that Kalista is complete crap late game, but she’s stronger than you’d think, even though she doesn't compare to actual hypercarry ADCs. 

I could be totally wrong, and the meta could shift to something I couldn’t have dreamed of in a million years. Just take this as my personal take. The meta will change from swiss to knock out to Finals, so it’s really impossible to tell at this point. To summarize my personal opinion,  

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary** 

Predictions before play-ins: Supportive ADC’s like Ashe and Jhin will be meta, Top &amp; JG will play carry picks, mid mages will be strong. 

&amp;#x200B;

The playin meta: ADC hypercarry meta, and junglers mostly played tanks. Mid mages were strong.  

&amp;#x200B;

Swiss stage predictions: We will have a Top &amp; Jungle Carry meta, with a few ADC hypercarry comps sprinkled in depending on the team. Teams will try to snowball through bot and roll the snowball up to top. And in the process, the high priority champions will be strong side laners like Gnar, Gwen, Jax and bot snowball champs like Kalista. Some ADCs might play hypercarry ADCs like Xayah and Kaisa. Azir, Syndra, and Orianna will be strong picks in the midlane.

Why not take more mages into the bot lane role?

Hi everyone,

I don't normally make these posts, but just wanted to share how I feel about the upcoming Worlds 2023 as a long time T1 fan.

I've watched T1 play since their 2013 debut, and have cheered the team on ever since. I've been heavily invested in the ups and downs of the team, and for the past 2 years it's been rough. 

The current T1 roster for some reason makes me so emotionally invested... Despite their potential, they've fell short from earning any international titles.

That being said, watching the individual videos of T1 players expectations and thoughts on the upcoming championship truly makes me sad... it really does feel like regardless of the outcome, we will see a change to this roster.

All in all, I truly wish the best for this team and I will send them my energy for every game of this tournament. I know they can be the protagonist for this tournament and truly represent what Deft has sad about unbreakable will.

top,Quick play taking over blind pick vs fill players,"I might be a niche part of the player base but hear me out. 

Let me start with I'm part of the sad regions that do not have normal draft. So If quick play straight up removes blind pick I will not have a ranked option on summoners rift apart from quick play. 

Im one of those players who plays fill in normals and likes to match my champ to my team comp. (I play most roles equally as badly so it doesn't really matter ) however quick play taking over blind pick seems quite worrying for me. The whole shtick of my friend group is we are all fill players and depending on the mood we all swap out our roles and champs or play with knowledge of what our new guest friend is picking. 

 Quick play may remove this from my friend group. And we usually play as a group of 3 and 4 so playing ranked flex isn't a consistent thing to do. (I can play soloq when playing alone ) 

This wouldn't be an issue if there was any other normal play mode. But saying it will completely replace blind pick is quite worrying for me. Will smaller regions only have quick play ? Or will smaller regions finally have two normal modes.",o0SHeeP0o,1697619107.0,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17am0na/quick_play_taking_over_blind_pick_vs_fill_players/

top,"LPL fans, how do you stay so confident about the region?","Okay trust me the title doesn't say the full picture of my thoughts. I'm a LPL fan, and I do think LPL should be the slight favorites for this Worlds because of this insane JDG team, and great LPL summer split. But I think I'm unlike other LPL fans, that I'm not confident about the overall LPL showing at all. And this is because of the swiss stage. A LPL team implodes in Worlds every single goddamn year, and I'm honestly getting a bit traumatized by it. Feels like ever since 2020, every LPL team gets rated highly coming into Worlds but 1 or 2 teams shit the bed in group stage, while LCK gets every team in quarters. I'm tired of this expectation just to feel depressed in group, this year swiss stage so I'm fully expecting WBG and one of BLG/LNG to not make it at this point. If they all do, I'll be very pleasantly surprised and happy but I'm not expecting it. 

But once LPL reaches the knockout stage, I'm very confident in them. I thought that EDG could genuinely win vs DK when they were huge underdogs, I thought RNG were as good as T1, when the 18-0 T1 roster was considered by fans to be the greatest roster ever.

The crazy thing is that I think LPL has a much higher chance of winning worlds than actually getting all 4 teams into knockout stage. The scrims rumor so far support this happening again as well. I'm not one of those ppl who think scrims don't matter, well its fair if you do. But the current scrim rumor is that the best scrim teams are all LCK teams and JDG+G2. All LCK teams and the chinese 1st seed in semis has happened for the last 2 years, albeit due to different reasons such as CN vs CN in quarters and FPX drama but it doesn't inspire confidence.

So, LPL fans how do you stay so confident? I need some of that copium, I think western fans were the ones that needed copium but I need some rn. I'll not be happy if its the JDG and LCK show, and JDG wins worlds.",katareky,1697639776.0,3,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17asbh8/lpl_fans_how_do_you_stay_so_confident_about_the/

top,Patch 13.20 PS Tier List,"PS is a well known youtube channel &amp; meta site(lol.ps) many Rank players and even Proplayers take account.  
They also have global channel in English so check them out.

&amp;#x200B;

They post Tier List contents every patch, although their contents are based on KR server it sure is very useful.

Champion tiers are determined based on data from the KR server tiers Emerald and above.

The criteria for selecting champion tiers is based on the champion pick rate, win rate, ban rate, counter rate, and data in high elo rank comprehensively. A pick rate of over 0.5% is required to be in the tier list.  


[https:\/\/lol.ps\/statistics](https://preview.redd.it/7pbtgwwh9wub1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57500be91d60a6aeab1841803447e227be8c642f)

Let's start at Top. If you look at the Tier 1 lineup, you'll be taken aback.

Aatrox Darius Fiora Yone Jax, all five champions are tricky to play against. We'll only be able to ban one of them, and I'd probably ban Aatrox.

Obviously, the champion that top players have been talking about a lot lately would be **Yone, Jax, and his friends.**

**Aatrox** has a 13.7% pick rate and a 50.4% win rate, looking like a safe first pick champ, and able to take the initiative easily. Compared to the last patch, he's lost a bit of momentum. What we've expected for Top this patch is that champions will decline due to nerfs such as Conqueror and Grasp of the Undying-based champions are going to have a chance, and he wasn’t able to get out of the woods 100%. **He's still a good first pick champ, but not a free-for-all pick**

We mentioned that Grasp of the Undying-based champions got a chance this patch. A prime example is **Fiora. With a 7% pick rate and a 50.8% win rate**, she made it into Tier 1. We've seen some improvements in her power curve, where her first-core timing, which was a bit elusive, has been improved. It's also a good enough card against Aatrox, Yone, and Jax.

If you go higher up in rank, only Darius gets down from Tier 1 and **Rumble** seems to be taking over, So it's like the top players' preferences are almost somewhat the same. However, Rumble is a difficult pick to use properly unless you're in Master tier or higher.

On the other hand, **Jax**'s data is yet again going astray. The changes to the motions this patch have made him smoother to deal damage, And we've seen tiers rise despite a bug that will eventually hurt him. At tiers Emerald and above, we aren’t sure if the win rate changes based on proficiency, And it's not until you get to tiers Master and above that the pick rate is 16.3% and the win rate is 51.2%. At the end of the day, we don't think Jax’s tier went up because his damage increased, or because his durability got too good, But instead we think it's more of an increase in convenience than anything else. So we think it's fair to say that it's only going to rate well for more skilled players. But like we said beforehand, it's also a patch version that champions using Grasp of the Undying have a chance at, So Jax is a good pick right now.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/lol.ps\/statistics](https://preview.redd.it/4crhtlx8bwub1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28d36fe4dd060d50876efa57ba441dd4db001a19)

**Jungle. This is the position that really got sniped this patch,** And here's Tier 1, with a total of five champs; Graves Lee Sin Karthus Rammus Nidalee. 

**Graves is on a roll right now, up 11 spots to the top rankings.** If AD junglers know when to utilize Doran’s Blade And this becomes more widespread, we may be able to see a more interesting power balance between junglers. For now, Graves is showing off selfish stats, and as of today, he’s got close to a **25% pick rate**. And his **ban rate** is quickly **exceeding 20%.**  And yet, his win rate is creeping upwards to the point where it negates this disastrous pick rate increase. The Youmuu's buff this patch has really helped Graves, And the changes to the jungle as a whole didn't really impact Graves at all, so he’s relatively more powerful than before. 

Champions like Graves, Karthus, and Nidalee who don't get affected as hard by the jungling changes or even Briar and Ivern at the top of Tier 2 are in a relatively better situation. In the case of **Ivern**, his **pick rate** is actually still **low at 1.8**%, but his **win rate** is still in the **54% range**. On the other hand, as we pointed out at Top, the late game value is good. 

**Champs** who struggled in solo queue due to **weak jungling are getting another chance**. **Rammus has a 5.5% pick rate and a 53.5% win rate**, and **Maokai has a 7.1% pick rate and a 52% win rate.** These guys are prime examples. Instead, you need to have really good late game value. Unless you have outstanding late game value, you're still going to be held back by your jungling ability. It has to be almost as strong **as the power graph** you're looking at right now, with **a late game win rate of over 55%.**

**Sylas Jungle is an interesting case.** We were wondering if it would no longer be a thing after this patch because **jungling is so hard.** Sylas Jungle itself is still **hard to play this patch, but not unplayable**. We think **he’s defending his data as other champs have received more damage. He has a 6.9% pick rate and a 49.6% win rate.**

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/lol.ps\/statistics](https://preview.redd.it/yb1ad0tscwub1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=403b700a6e09514431c90bebeee872a36af5584b)

For the mid lane, we’ve also picked **five Tier 1 champs Sylas Orianna Taliyah Irelia Akali.**

Surprisingly, **Akshan did get a nerf this patch** and he’s been on a downward spiral. But it's amazing that he's managed to stay on the edge of Tier 1. He's truly a solo queue champion. He has a **3.5% pick rate and a 52.4% win rate.**

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/lol.ps\/champ\/517](https://preview.redd.it/pra5oba6dwub1.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e3c9011977678afea9191502640876c172ceb4a)

**We'll give the OP mark to Sylas.** He has a **pick rate of 13.4% and a win rate of 50.5%**, and he's a champion who should be difficult to pick first but nevertheless. He's also playing a lot of different runes, so we think he needs to be lit up more. We'll try to put together a Sylas featurette video soon. From runes to items and playstyles, we bet you have a lot of questions.

**Naafiri and Neeko**, even though they're **in Tier 2**, are champions with **very high win rates**. We’ll keep it simple and just go over their performance stats. **Naafiri has a 2.7% pick rate and a 53.6% win rate**, while **Neeko has a 2.5% pick rate and a 52.9% win rate.** The difference between the two is that **Naafiri's pick rate has been increasing recently**, While **Neeko's pick rate is going down**. But **they are both good picks.** **Yone is in Tier 2 with a 12.7% pick rate and a 48.5% win rate**. He has the **second highest pick rate at mid after Sylas**.

&amp;#x200B;

**After the AD LeBlanc, Statikk Shiv nerf, the devs gave a nudge to go back to AP,** And they said the compensation patch at the time worked for LeBlanc on AP items, so no additional buffs were needed. Immediately after the nerf, we were told that the Statikk Shiv LeBlanc’s data was chipping away at her stats as a whole. We're really close to the AP build now, and LeBlanc is still struggling with a 5% pick rate and 45.8% win rate. Moving up to tiers Diamond and above, he has a 4.5% pick rate and 47.3% win rate, At Master and above a 4.4% pick rate and 44.7% win rate, and and Bronze to Platinum a 5.1% pick rate and 45.4% win rate. Yes. **LeBlanc is very difficult to use at any tier right now**, and she's still getting picked. **As the developers have said, we wonder if they’ll give us another LeBlanc buff.**

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/lol.ps\/statistics](https://preview.redd.it/1tlnz1oqdwub1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a036561bd1ac1138e836ffbf32d63fc273741ab5)

There are more honey champs than usual since it’s after a big patch. We'll give **Ezreal an OP mark. 27.5% pick rate, 51.5% win rate, a dominant performance.** No matter how untrustworthy he’s been at Worlds, **No other ADC is as good as Ezreal in solo queue.** Considering that the recently-gone-viral unlimited stacks full AS Jinx has a 29.4% pick rate and a 50% win rate, You can see how Ezreal is putting up right now.

The viral champion **Jinx** has made it to **Tier 1**. As of today, she has a **35% pick rate,** and her **ban rate is approaching 20%**. The next patch will include a nerf to Jinx's passive stack. But regardless, it's fun, and users will want to experience how dope it is, So ADC players might still lean towards Jinx.

The **buffed Ziggs is doing a great job at bot**. We’re still cautious about recommending Ziggs Mid, But Ziggs Bot has definitely become a viable joker pick. **He's got a 3.5% pick rate and a 53.7% win rate**, and as of today, he's even gone above the 5% pick rate. Maybe without the turret plate gold nerf, he Ziggs Bot meta might have been fully established. It's still pretty good as it is though. He's got to the point where there's no bot champion with a win rate disadvantage.

One champion to watch is Armor Pen Miss Fortune, who is seeing a resurgence with the Youmuu’s buff. Her pick rate is slightly up from the previous patch, but she doesn't seem to be getting much attention. The value of Miss Fortune leading to Youmuu’s-Collector seems pretty good, so you might want to give it a try.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/lol.ps\/statistics](https://preview.redd.it/0cziljtwnwub1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=317fffc6639a955cb67b5d87061f5f73e7bd0e67)

The usual suspects, **Blitz, Rakan, Thresh, and Nautilus, are in Tier 1**. We aren’t going to give out a bunch of OP marks though. They’re showing good, but not great, performances. Maybe it's a different kind of balance. 

**Senna deserves the spotlight. She's stepped up once more with a 9.9% pick rate and 51.7% win rate**. She has good late-game value, and she's a champion who can adopt items like Umbral Glaive and Youmuu's So we think the potential is higher. As of today, she's already over a 10% pick rate So we think it's safe to say **she's practically Tier 1.**

**Maokai, who has higher late-game potential** than Senna, has also had a higher pick rate recently. **He has a 2% pick rate and a 53.5% win rate, so you should consider him. Morgana got patched** And Morgana Jungle has been getting a lot of attention, **so her pick rate as Support has also increased quite a bit**. There was a significant increase in her data, with a **pick rate of 4.7% and a win rate of 49.3%**. However, it's **not a perfect match for the current meta, so it has some limitations.**

top,My experience as a lee sin one trick in aram.,"Ah, another day dawns, and what better way to spend it than indulging in my ARAM addiction, featuring my beloved Lee Sin.

I graciously rise from my 29-ARAM-marathon-induced slumber at the highly productive hour of 2 am. With immense enthusiasm, I shout to the heavens, ""ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TRIUMPH IN THE PRESTIGIOUS ARAM MODE OF LEAGUE OF LEGENDS!""

As I click the ""League of Legends"" icon, I'm greeted by an enigmatic app called ""Riot Client"" – it dares to demand my ""username"" and ""password."" Curiosity piqued, I decide to create a fresh account of the day. Behold, ""LeEsinsblind"" is born, and it tells me I've successfully signed up in OCE, a realm I have absolutely no clue about! Riot Games, the masterminds behind League of Legends, must've recognized my true potential and granted me this unheard-of rank!

I dive into a brisk warm-up ARAM, and what do you know, Lee Sin graces me with his presence. To clarify for the less enlightened among you, Lee Sin is a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-everything champion. His hidden passive? Rendering me blind as a bat, and not due to any moonshine incident, mind you.

His Q ability is an auto-targeted missile that homes in on the nearest ADC, whether in this game or the next, revealing their location and providing me with vital information like their credit score and their mother's relationship status. If I'm not satisfied with their financial health, a quick Q-press sends them packing, wiping their League account and transferring their gold to my offshore bank account.

My W ability involves dashing to an ""Ally"" and shielding them, but let's be real; shields are overrated when you've already started the game with four Death Dances and can heal from true damage. No big deal.

My E, well, it marks the area around Lee Sin, essentially functioning as an AoE nuke. Unfortunately, it only obliterates nearby champions and provides a meager 300 in-game currency. Such a pittance, I know.

And now, Lee Sin's pièce de résistance, his ultimate, R. Trying to explain it to mere mortals is a task reserved for the elite minds of at least Bronze 4. I'll demonstrate its incredible power in due course.

As the game begins, the enemy team quakes in terror at the mere sight of me, Lee Sin, who shows no mercy. I order them to line up in front of their nexus, as their towers and inhibitors have wisely sworn allegiance to my cause. Their feeble cries fall on deaf ears as I meticulously pass judgment with my Q, one by one.

But this becomes tiresome; I'm already drained from the monumental effort of queuing up. So, I hit that E button, instantly obliterating all players and granting me a handsome stack of gold to purchase my one and only necessary item: Duskblade of Draktharr. I even Venmo some random Ornn player to upgrade it to Draktharr's Shadowcarver because, let's face it, I'm too busy being awesome.

The enemy team attempts to surrender, realizing their futility against my unparalleled might, but I, the benevolent Lee Sin, reject their pleas as I eagerly await the airdrop of my new item.

At last, I decide it's time to claim my rightful victory. I casually stroll up to the enemy Rammus, who's rocking a cool 971 armor, and press my ultimate at him. Together, we watch in awe as he rockets towards his own nexus, shattering their base, and presumably, his monitor along with it.

The victory screen warmly welcomes me, and with the profound humility only Lee Sin can muster, I queue up for another exhilarating All Random All Mid. Because really, why waste time on anything else?",ereface,1697669224.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b3po5/my_experience_as_a_lee_sin_one_trick_in_aram/

But PC League has a lackluster version of these or not even even that.   


Wild Rift that is made by Riot, has really cool looking animated and interactive champion 3d models that you can examine, but this is non existent on PC League. Dota 2 customization of your game is miles ahead of league, with custom VO for announcers (rn during the international they have several announcer packs from casters, and community members from different regions to purchase), map skins, UI skins, custom profile layouts, and so on. And the amount of stats data that you can access in Dota 2 is immense in comparison.  


I'm aware that league has way more pressing issues with its service/client that need to be addressed first (for example, it's been almost 800 days and the BR server still has account transfers blocked). But my question is:   


With the large amount of funding that Riot has, enough to fund multiple games (Wild Rift, Legends of Runeterra, TFT, League Stories Games, Project L, League MMO, etc), Hollywood level production of shows (Arcane, Arcane Season 2), Musical productions with several famous artists (Lil Nas X, New Jeans, Twice, G-Idle, Imagine Dragons, etc), then why? When it comes to its main core game, they seem to not add new features (its taken multiple years for them to allow us to choose a different language of the client in League, this is coming in November), QoL and customization stuff that Riot themselves implemented to its other games under the same IP?  


It's a tech issue? Funding issue? Management issue?",Luckrow,1697650208.0,2,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17awc3m/why_are_we_not_using_cool_features_from_other/
top,MAD Hylissong reflects on grinding SoloQ,"# 1.)Getting flamed in SoloQ:

*Interviewer:* 

You have a special playstyle and like to limit test a lot. Do you ever get flamed or inted by your team in SoloQ?

*Hylissong:*

Oh yeah, it happens a lot. You have teammates, who go play like 50 games a day, then they're just burned out. They feel like I am inting, but they don't say it, because they are chat restricted, right? So they bait ping me instead.

They don't feel like I am doing anything right and I don't feel like they want to play with me or something so I just roam and make plays happen.And it turns into a vicious cycle.

""This cycle is very exhausting and not productive.""

&amp;#x200B;

# 2.)Dealing with toxicity:

*Interviewer:*

Do you ever flame back or how do you deal with this kind of toxicity?

*Hylissong:*

I usually mute and ignore them. Sometimes I'll add them and I'll tell them something, and they react the wrong way. But that's on me because I didn't choose the right moment, especially if they were emotional post-game,but it's completely understandable and normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 3.) Difference between Pro and Non-pro schedule:

*Interviewer:* 

When you became a pro, how did your schedule change?

*Hylissong:*

When I became pro there was a planned schedule on what I should be doing throughout the day: when I am playing solo queue, when I am having fun, when I am going for dinner, when I am having gym, and when I am having review — all these things planned. 

It's not spamming games all day long, and then you feel like crap going to bed and then the next day is exactly the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 4.)Benefit of a pro schedule:

*Interviewer:*

Do you see any benefits following the schedule?

*Hylissang:*

I would say so. After one bad thing goes wrong, it's not like, ""Oh my god..."" My mental is very stable, strong, and I'm also good mechanically right now. I can say that's because of the things I now do before the day starts, the more balanced schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5.) SoloQ advice for beginners

*Interviewer:*

Do you have any advice for people, who can't get out of elo hell?

*Hylissong:*

Play champions you personally like — kind of your pocket picks, so that's probably it. And yeah, also try not to dwell on negative thoughts during the game. Instead, be more about having fun and reviewing things if they go south, not just ignoring them. So, just focus on having a good time and not ending the day hating yourself or your teammates. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Interviewer:* 

Thank you for the interview!

A little background on my situation: I’m a multi-account master tier ADC main looking to give something back to the community that I grew up with through solo queue coaching. I’ve tutored both in college and high school, but outside of that I have no coaching experience in league or anywhere else. I sometimes review vods of my friends/mutuals to help others improve, and overall I have a very strong sense of macro knowledge in my particular role. I found that there are very few ADC educational content creators, coaches and resources compared to other roles so I figure the market is open to ADC coaches at the moment.

I am looking at the first page of google for coaching services and applying to each one I am qualified for. However, I am a bit stuck on what exactly I should be doing to get prepared. So far I’ve:
-Watched countless Challenger ADC Coaching videos on YT
-Began setting up a Coachify profile

My question is, what are the best coaching services right now I should look to be a part of to start as and grow myself as a coach?

top,Why the Swiss Format is the West's true hope this Worlds! I ran the numbers.,"I've never seen the Swiss format before, so I decided to create a Python script to simulate it. I ran this simulation millions of times, collecting data for analysis. What I've found is quite interesting.

A common narrative I’m hearing about Swiss from people who’ve seen it in other esports is that “if there’s an upset things will get weird.”  

While it’s true, it’s also missing something big: **The Swiss stage does not need upsets to get weird.**

To prove this point I want to rank the teams, and to remove my own bias we can use the outright betting odds from multiple sites and take the averages. This is what it looks like.



| Rank | Region | Team | Outright Win Odds |
|------|--------|------|--------------|
| 1    | LPL    | JDG  | 1.445        |
| 2    | LCK    | Gen.G | 4.389        |
| 3    | LPL    | LNG  | 5.515        |
| 4    | LCK    | T1   | 7.53         |
| 5    | LPL    | WBG  | 9.083        |
| 6    | LPL    | BLG  | 9.333        |
| 7    | LCK    | KT   | 12.41        |
| 8    | LCK    | DK   | 14.5         |
| 9    | LEC    | G2   | 40.553       |
| 10   | LEC    | FNC  | 78.333       |
| 11   | LEC    | MAD  | 88.667       |
| 12   | LCS    | C9   | 98.333       |
| 13   | LCS    | NRG  | 177.777      |
| 14   | LCS    | TL   | 252.777      |
| 15   | LEC    | BDS  | 275          |
| 16   | VCS    | GAM  | 444.444      |

Thankfully region distribution works out neatly, the top 8 teams are from the LCK and LPL, and there’s a bit of a gulf between DK (rank 8) and G2 (rank 9).

Let’s define an upset as any rank 9-16 team beating a rank 1 to 8 team, which is the same as saying an upset is an LEC/LCS/VCS team beating a LCK/LPL team.

I ran the simulation while setting the chance of upsets to 0%, and gave regions win rates. Here’s a chart of it.

| Region 1 | Region 2 | Region 1 WR(%) |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| LCK      | LCK      | 50%             |
| LCK      | LPL      | 50%             |
| LCK      | LCS      | 100%            |
| LCK      | LEC      | 100%            |
| LCK      | VCS      | 100%            |
| LPL      | LPL      | 50%             |
| LPL      | LCS      | 100%            |
| LPL      | LEC      | 100%            |
| LPL      | VCS      | 100%            |
| LCS      | LCS      | 50%             |
| LCS      | LEC      | 50%             |
| LCS      | VCS      | 50%             |
| LEC      | LEC      | 50%             |
| LEC      | VCS      | 50%             |
| VCS      | VCS      | 50%             |
| VCS      | PI       | 50%             |


To summarise the chart, if a 1 to 8th ranked team is playing a 9 to 16th ranked team, they have a 100% win rate, every other matchup is a 50% win rate. 

Now this is where things get juicy.

I ran the simulation 100k times and these are the results.

| Teams Advancing | Non-LCK/LPL |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 0               | 37814       |
| 1               | 60756       |
| 2               | 1429        |
| 3               | 1           |
| 4               | 0           |


**Without ever beating an LCK or LPL team, 1 or more LEC/LCS/VCS teams advance in 62% of simulations.**

The real clever ones reading this probably have also realised that for this to be true, LPL/LCK teams will be going home without ever losing to anyone but LPL/LCK teams.

Pretty cool for the west right? Bare in mind these stats above are an absolute minimum as clearly the Western teams will have a better win rate against LPL/LCK teams than 0%... surely.

If we compare Swiss with the old Groups format using the same seeding pools, you’ll see how much better this format is for us. 

With the old format, using the same win-rate method as above, not a single LEC/LCS/VCS team will ever advance to quarters. This is because each group will have an LCK team and an LPL team and they will get 4 wins plus, meanwhile this means the other 2 teams lose 4 each at a minimum.

Due to the increased randomness of Swiss over the old Groups stage, and to the detriment of getting the true best 8 teams into the finals, the west is definitely happy here. Should we feel bad that it’s very likely an LCK / LPL team will drop out of the tournament by losing only to LCK / LPL teams? Probably, but hey it will be nice to win for once.

I have more data using dummy team by team win rates, trying to simulate closer to what will happen. I got to these win rates by working backwards from the outright winning odds, and trial and error with win rates until the output matched the outright. Perhaps I’ll go in depth of it, that’s for another post though. Here are some interesting things I learned, bare in mind the accuracy relies on the quality of the input, and it’s impossible to know the true odds before teams play.

1) In Swiss the average rank difference between teams in games is smaller than Groups, by approximately 1.1. Meaning we get more competitive matches. Groups has far more completely one sided matchups.

2) Over 72% of scenarios had 2 or more LEC/LCS/VCS teams advancing

3)  Only 1.3% of scenarios had 0 LEC/LCS/VCS teams advancing, so 98.7% had at least 1.",PandoranHuman,1697656948.0,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17ayyrq/why_the_swiss_format_is_the_wests_true_hope_this/

Together with the range indicator there is now also a projectile indicator. Normally I don't really mind those kinds of changes but this indicator is really really distracting to me because you have to channel the spell and it's there for the full duration. Like I said things like this normally don't bother me but this is quite a bad ""QoL"" change in my opinion. It doesn't look that bad in the picture but when you play the champ it just feels so off and distracting. Maybe there is a chance they revert it, if not this is actually a thing that sadly would make me not want to play Varus.

I think that if they are changing the rift they are likely or at least should consider using this new terrain type in those changes. Especially with the elemental drake map changes. Deep water from the ocean drake makes thematic sense.
To keep the purists happy, they could leave the base map still and make the drake maps more drastic and should include the deep water.

top,Some possible champion changes,"**Kayn:**

\-  Kayn already has an indicator for his E but it shows only either his full duration length or the reduced length. While there is already an audio cue thats played when his E runs out due to not being in a wall, I think a visual clarification via an indicator could also help.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I think similarly an Out-of-Champion-Combat-Indicator could help so that you aren't suprised when you directly exit the wall . Maybe for this and the previous point there could also be an elegant solution which I don't see.

&amp;#x200B;

\- On the vision of E: I feel lt is unintuitive for enemies, that he just has a vision radius around him when inside a wall and can thus see over other walls he isn't inside off. I don't think you can see his shadowball inside the wall through FoW, so the enemies don't know that he sees them. Either walls could proberly block vision or the enemies could be notified wth eyes over their head.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  Expanding on the point of vision in E, it can be confusing for Kayn himself to understand that he doesn't get vision in bushes during E (same for Zoe Ult).  Normaly bushes you don't have vision of throw a shadow onto themselfes. However since for Kayn/Zoe during E/R bushes don't throw a shadow it looks as if you have vision inside, even though you don't.  I understand that at least for kayn, if bushes would throw shadows his vision inside some walls would get severely nerfed,  but one could also try to implement that the bushes don't apear as bright.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rammus/Nunu:**

\- It would be great if you could cast Predator while using powerball/biggest snowball ever! without canceling the effect

\- same for the ARAM summoner spell mark

&amp;#x200B;

**Aphelios:**

\- make E castable while dead, so that I can think about gun rotations while dead. And maybe add the weapon symbol to the notification so that its quicker to see. Additionally let it display offhand amunition while dead (or maybe let us cast w while dead instead? idk)

\- release an legendary/ultimate skin where aphelios talks instead of alune (money hack$$$)

&amp;#x200B;

**Janna:**

\- let Janna use E during her R channel

&amp;#x200B;

**Jayce:**

\- make his melee E less buggy. Knockback away from Jayce in the correct direction.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hecarim:**

\- give him one emote, where he does a pesade/levade while neighing. Could even do it at the start of his E?

&amp;#x200B;

The following points might be more controversal and I'm not sure if I want them changed myself, they are just ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fiddlesticks:**

\- remove the unintended R-W-F combo

**Jarvan IV:**

\- adjust his manacosts, so that he is not completly troll in lane.

**Senna:**

\- max her range at 100 souls. Still gain additional AD from further souls.

**Zilean:**

\- just remove the clunky passive and give only him passively bonus exp

top,Easy Tweak Champs for Jungle,"As 13.20 and now 13.21 patches have shown with the changes to Morgana, Zyra, and Brand, Riot is trying to broaden the number of champs who are jungle viable, even nerfing other parts of their kit slightly after the buffs required for jungle.

I think that there is some low-hanging fruit that Riot is missing out on, and I was wondering what others people had. Champions who could jungle with minor tweaks, feel different to play than current junglers, and would be healthy for the game as a whole.

Cho'gath: All he needs is an increase in his monster cap on his E. At rank 1 the 3% max health damage caps at a measly 60 damage - which even slows down his first clear as the level 1 buffs have 2.3k health (without the cap he'd do 9 more damage per E - 27 more damage per cast) while the caps are really designed to prevent champs from taking down objectives too quick. While Cho's ult is great during smite fights, the more common tank build is actually really bad at taking down objectives quickly. (Most of his damage comes from ult &amp; % health on his E)

A change on his cap from 60+20/rank to maybe 100+20/stack would speed up his first couple clears to be semi-competitive (still on the slow side) and average at objectives. Nothing else in his kit would need to change.

I think Cho'gath jungle would be healthy for the game since while he has 3 CCs and an execute, his lack of gap-closers (or any movement) keeps him from being too annoying to play against when 2/3 of his CCs and his execute are close-range and the third is telegraphed. (Unlike if Lissandra was made a viable jungler as Phreak mentioned.)

top,The Stats we don't see,"Hi all,

So I'm writing this in the hopes Riot will consider implementing so additional information regarding how effective items are. Currently most items show how much additional healing, shielding, damage etc they are giving, and in some cases (Spirit Visage, Eclipse, Divine Sunderer) we can see multiple types of benefits.

Currently there are a few missing that I think would be good to see, most notably the new adc mythics are all lacking information as to their additional damage output.

Infinity Edge additional Crit damage

Navori Quickblades additional Crit damage and cd reduction

Bloodthirster additional damage and healing done

Collector number of executes and gold

Lord Dominics additional damage through % pen 

Voidstaff through additional %pen

Rylais Crystal Scepter time slowed (sec)

Cosmic Drive movement speed active (sec)

Riftmaker healing done

Shieldbow healing done

Blade of the Ruined King healing done

Ravenous Hydra healing done

Mortal Reminder damage from % pen

Guinsoos Rageblade on hit damage done, additional on hit damage done (for other items producing off this) and additional damage done from %pen

Serylda's Grudge additional damage from %pen and time slowed (sec)

Divine Sunderer additional damage from %pen

Plated Steel caps damage reduced from auto attacks

Eclipse additional damage from %pen

Runaans Hurricane additional damage from on hit damage and additional damage from on hit damage from other items

I feel adding these would give players a lot more clarity on what their items are actually doing ingame as the many already showing these details do.

I would also suggest adding additional damage from flat pen items like Sorcerer boots and Lethality items.

I'm interested if others would like to see this information. Let me know your thoughts.

top,League needs a good PvE mode,"I've always been a bit of a tryhard in league because it was the only game I could play on my shitty laptop at the time and I thought that's just how you're supposed to play. To a large extent I'm still that despite being ok with someone playing off meta picks I still kind of just mentally accepted the loss and moved on. I never really understood the appeal I guess. 

Then I built my current pc which can run basically any game I can think of and I got into elden ring. A large part of elden ring content online (if you're not into PvP and I'm def not into elden ring PvP lol) is challenge runs with weird builds. Some of my favourite YouTubers are LilAggy and Bushy if you want an example of what I'm talking about. When I saw their content I really enjoyed it despite me not liking offmeta stuff in league and I think it's because elden ring is PvE. 

Imo the biggest problem with playing offmeta in league is that it's a team game and there's always someone who won't be ok with you playing suboptimally because they want to win in the more standard way instead of whatever whacky shenanigans your pick gets up to. If you're playing something like idk shack support and your adc has never played with a shaco before the lane is gonna be unnecessarily hard right? 

This is why I think League needs a good PvE mode like Odyssey in 2018. It's explicitly for fun and maybe you can even grind it for rewards but the important thing is that it's playing against an AI so if you decide to go ap graves or something it's no big deal. 

Urf kinda used to be like this before everyone figured out that ADCs were the best role even in urf (wow shocker adc is op who could have seen this coming) but even that was playing against other people. I think we can all agree that being the weird off meta pick in urf and being ahead and cheesing everyone is very fun but being the victim of the offmeta pick and being cheesed makes you want to break your monitor. 

What do you guys think? Would you want an Odyssey style PvE mode? I feel like it would be really good for the game.",Vanilla_Breeze,1697661904.0,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b0vjq/league_needs_a_good_pve_mode/
top,Singed Rework Concept," Goals of this concept:

1. Highlight his Identity of a twisted doctor with tons of body-horror
2. Keep Q and E, change the rest
3. make him use his shield properly

&amp;#x200B;

**Passive**  
**Careful Observation**

**INNATE:** Singed's basic attacks are empowered to deal 5-81 (Level 1-18) (+ 30% AP) bonus magic damage and causes him to enter Observation against the target for 5 seconds.

This effect cannot occur on the same target once every 30 / 25 / 20 (Levels 1/7/13) seconds (affected by ability haste).

**OBSERVATION:** Singed raises his shield in the target enemy's direction, gaining 10-40% (Level 1-18) (+ 1% per 300 bonus Health) (+ 1% per 100 bonus armor) (+ 1% per 100 bonus magic resistance) damage reduction in that direction.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q**  
**Poison Trail**

Static Cooldown: 1 | Cost: 10 Mana per Second

**PASSIVE:** While Poison Trail is toggled off, Singed gains 2 / 3.5 / 5 / 6.5 / 8% bonus armor and magic resistance and 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15 bonus health regeneration.

**TOGGLE:** Singed gains 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 12% bonus movement speed and continually creates a toxic cloud in his wake that lingers for 3.25 seconds. The cloud inflicts Poison to enemies within, and resets the duration every 0.5 seconds while they remain.

**POISON:** The target takes 4 / 7 / 10 / 13 / 16 (+ 10% AP) magic damage every 0.25 seconds, slows them by 20% and grounds them over 2 seconds. Subsequent inflictions refresh the duration.

&amp;#x200B;

**W**  
**Injection from Afar**

Static Cooldown: 2 | Cost: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 Mana

**ACTIVE:** Singed shoots a syringe in the target direction which stops at the first enemy hit, dealing 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100 (+ 45% AP) magic damage and stunning them for 1 second.

Singed gains a Charge of Injection from Afar every 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 seconds, up to a maximum of 2 Charges.

&amp;#x200B;

**E**  
**Fling**

Cooldown: 10 / 9.5 / 9 / 8.5 / 8 | Cost: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Mana

**ACTIVE:** Singed flings the target enemy 550 units over himself, dealing 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 (+ 60% AP) (+ 7 / 7.5 / 8 / 8.5 / 9% of the target's maximum Health) magic damage, capped against minions and monsters.

After the cast time, he enters Observation against the flung target for 5 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

**R**  
**The Host**

Cooldown: 160 / 140 / 120 | Cost: 100 Mana

**PASSIVE:** Enemy champions damaged by Singed are marked for 4 seconds.

**ACTIVE:** Singed pulls all marked targets in the center relative to their position and merges them into one unit called Experiment for 4 seconds.

The Experiment has 345 movement speed and it's health consists of 100% of all merged target's current health. The Experiment is disarmed and grounded. All merged champions can cast abilities and put in the location where the unit should go, although the Experiment will go to the (hierarchically) first location.

Singed and his allies can damage the Experiment, where 40 / 50 / 60% of all post-mitigation damage dealt to this unit will also be dealt to all merged enemies at the end of the duration. If the Experiment dies, all merged champions also die.",SpringBossLP,1697659706.0,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17b01eq/singed_rework_concept/

top,Strange trend in ranked - thoughts/theories?,"Hi guys. My last dozen or so ranked games have been 2v8. My bot lane is just running it down without intentionally running it down (bless their hearts, they are trying). Same with my mid - albeit slightly less. I've had loss streaks before, but what the hell is happening with my mids and bots? I'm just seeing if anyone has experienced anything similar. If so, how did you solve?

# KDA from last 6 games (not duo with/camping top)

* My bot lane: 45/139/78
* My mid lane: 22/54/34
* Me (jungle): 29/26/62
* My top lane: 71/45/27

The KDAs don't do the situation justice because, once we get to mid-game, my top and I are able to somewhat make it competitive, so bot/mid's KDAs improve slightly. During the laning phase, it's absolutely absurd - like, 1-2/double-digits/1-2 sort of stuff. The feed is so demoralizing. Death after death after death. 2+ level disparities. 1-2 item disparities.

Jg: kanavi - imo the best player in the world(most impactful) right now. Even more dangerous that he’s paired with LPL’s best mid(debatable) and top. If Kanavi gets a good start, gg.

Mid: Knight - probably the ‘weak point’ of this team. Not to say he is a bad player in any way, he has just shown some inconsistencies especially in global stages. Still not a player to count out though, and is only a weak point due to his exceptional teammates.

ADC + Sup: Ruler is so fucking good at adc. He gives JDG the confidence that allows the team to play at their own pace. Ahead in the game? Kanavi 369 will win you the game. Early game didn’t go as planned? Just wait for Ruler to scale, there’s nobody that can put team fight him.

It's so good, in fact, that I think it's time to nerf Swain mid and buff support - the ACTUAL role players want him in!","Hello besties, as you may know, Riot is buffing Seraphine support. As part of these changes, they are reducing her scaling and giving her more early power - which is like, you know, kinda against her ""hyperscaling fantasy"" buuuuut I can accept it a bit so long as we remain a scaling champ. BUT, Phreak has clearly outlined that they are fine if Seraphine mid stops existing as collateral damage, since she has a super low &lt;0.50% PR in most elos so basically non-existant already.

HO-HO-HOEWEVER, I think this is a good moment to address the elephant in the room: **SWAIN**.

Over the years, Swain support, his most loyal fanbase has gotten nothing but changes that helped midlane and top because of incessant whining from mid and top, the roles that basically had no playrate. Right now his PR is at a whooping 1% after, what, 2, 3, Jhin's funny number of mini reworks?

And THAT'S where the changes landed?

WELL NO SIR, I SAY NO SIR!

We in the support role lost our super cool ""pull whenever enemy is CC"" for these mid fans clamoring for mages to hardly even play him anyway and forcing Swain into a perpetual 50% wr of ""oh, he is viable, not super good tho"" just because they whined and now don't even want to use him? and after all this they still complain about ""oh I would totally use him, you don't get it, I ACTUALLY love Swain and wish him to be viable"" except he is right there, he is literally standing there drinking a margarita in midlane, waiting for you to come inside his loving embrace and you are just there dumbfounded saying ""nu uh"".

wtf? 

Meanwhile, Supp's playerbase has only GROWN over the years, rising to a near 5%PR because we, support chads, love our ""Draco Malphoy's dad whose name I can't remember"" looking ahh crow daddy who probably gives good hugs💅. I say if they don't want him, give it to support players again, reintroduce CC pull on ally and give him MK Scorpion's ""GET OVER HERE"" anytime he uses it.

Anyway, that's just my what I think, I am looking forward to Seraphine's changes. *The Q speed buff specially will be so awesome! Let's go Seraqueens!*

&amp;#x200B;

Answer yourself honestly, how often do you really pay attention to the summoner names of other players? Or even use them to communicate, instead of adressing them by the name of their champion?

From my experience, 99% of the time people use champion names or don't communcate at all and the last time I saw someone pay attention to a clever joke or refference in someone's name was probably during season 4.

Not to mention that there are a lot of player who never cared about their summoner names anway and simply used a gibbersish of letters and numbers or generic words, just to have a name and play the game.

Additionally, LoL's playerbase is so huge that running into someone with the same name as yours or someone elses is going to border on a miracle. Unless you're playing in Masters and above where player count gets really low.

There is also the topic of impersonation and use of names of people popular in the LoL community, but that has been happening for years through use of special characters and other tricks so not much is going to change. There has been a very small handful of instances of me playing aginst or with someone who I thought could be a YouTuber only to find out that they're some kid who barely speaks english and knows the most colorful combinations of racial slures in the world.

top,I've asked this before and I'll ask it again: Why do we not get LP mitigation for people running it down mid,"So I genuinely can't fathom the reasoning for us not getting this besides the fact that riot seems to refuse to ban people who intentionally feed. However, they acknowledge that people afking is worth us not losing as much LP as possible.

So I ask: is this game more winnable than having an afk?

I understand how people say it takes time to process a ban and therefore they would have to refund LP after the lobby had closed, which is the most common answer I hear as to why logistically we couldn't get refunded for intentional feed. However, in what world is just saying ""lmao deal with it"" better than just changing lp after the match? 

I'm genuinely curious as to why this system isn't built to deal with something that seems to happen every third game. Not to sound too salty, but you can understand why.

Now, this 13.20 patch was basically intended to make jungle less op(?) and make junglers not the main character of the game.

Not to be too egocentric here but isn’t jungle arguably the hardest role in the game to execute on an actual good level? So I’m just wondering shouldn’t it be like the hardest role in the game is also the strongest role if done correctly no?

But okay, if we don’t want jungle to be the “main characters” of the game that still are the ones who gank lanes, track enemy jungler, secure objectives, etc. then who do we want the main characters of the game to be?

Or for mages, Liandry's Anguish. I am a four item tank, and Iose to one fucking item. Maokai is supposed to be a drain tank, we take a long fight and I outsustain you and wear you down with DoT. Instead, I get fucking removed with 0 counterplay because I got in your AA range. If tanks are so easy to delete, why bother making one in the first place? I understand specific anti-tank champs, like Fiora and Vayne, which is something you have to look out for in draft, but fucking Sett builds BoRK, Renekton builds BoRK, hell their Jungle Shaco builds BoRK and now I can't play the game.

top,Why does it seem like it's okay for support players to snatch other champions out of their main roles?,"I mean, just off the top of my head: Brand, Zyra, Ashe (previously), Fiddlesticks (previously), Morgana, Zilean, Swain (previously), Lux, Karma (kinda... not really? IDK), Xerath, and Vel'koz. That's eleven champions who were not originally designed as supports, or who were not originally designed to be PRIMARILY supports who have received balance changes specifically to appeal to support players and or to balance them for the lane. Including Seraphine who is slated for tweaks this upcoming patch, that makes **TWELVE** champions.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously it's a mystery to me how Ivern has managed to avoid this treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

When other champions start seeing too much play in any other lane they're almost always nerfed right away, ESPECIALLY if it is a support going into another lane. Pyke mid, Karma mid/top, Sona top (and bot!), Janna top, Seraphine bot, Camille jungle, Kalista top ETC. All of these are other examples of champions seeing viability in other lanes who were then FORCEFULLY taken out of those lanes. Why is that not okay, but Seraphine -who is an absolutely AWFUL support- gets moved into support because people decided they wanted to play her there?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I salty because Seraphine mid is (probably) effectively dead in the water next patch? Absolutely. I am a support player and honestly I'm sick of seeing random cheese show up in the role only for it to be accommodated to, but when supports show up in other roles it's almost always swifty nerfed. I mean, seriously, how many supports have undergone a lane swap that has received SERIOUS attention allowing them to stay there? Kench? Maybe Morgana jungle? Maybe Brand (his winrate is .2% higher midlane I guess, it's still sub 50%)?

&amp;#x200B;

A new support comes out and they're basically PLASTERED with little kinks that prevent them from ever seeing play in any lane other than support because the champion design team is absolutely terrified of Renata glasc making an appearance in mid lane, but they're just fine with turning every other artillery mage into a support. It's seriously a miracle neither Zoe or Taliyah have been reworked into supports at this point considering their overall aestetic.",HalexUwU,1697612518.0,0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17akhb6/why_does_it_seem_like_its_okay_for_support/
top,"Riot Ruined The Game By Nerfing Early Game Too Hard, I Hope New Season And Mythic Removal Comes Soon Because The Game Is In A Terrible State Right Now","There is no point in trying to play agressive and kill your laner early anymore. They made doran items way better, so champs that like to start longsword and rush first item are weaker. They nerfed respawn timers so that if you kill someone early they can tp a few seconds later with a good wavestate and actually come out ahead of you. For some reason they buffed Orianna and Syndra even more, just play scorch aery Orianna or Syndra midlane and no one will be able to outpoke you or beat you in lane, and even if someone does beat you and make you run it in lane killing you multiple times you still outscale them. They nerfed every single early game rune(aery only good one). They even nerfed turret plating gold.

Riot has massively slowed down the pace of the game and mistakes are way less punishing. They slowed the game down so much that even useless overnerfed champs like Aurelion Sol that loses to everyone in lane is getting nerfed. Where does this leave early game champions like Talon, that were already weak before this patch, and are now even more terrible?",bxgang,1697648284.0,0,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17avkff/riot_ruined_the_game_by_nerfing_early_game_too/
top,Does League have debuffs on downrank games?,"I want to know if someone else consistently experiences this.

&amp;#x200B;

I will have games where my attacks carve through anything and everything, and i will have games were it takes 6 auto attacks to kill a minion. This happens in downrank games, where league forces a loss on you in order to keep you at a 50% winrate. In uprank games at the same game time, items and level, i will 2 hit the same minion. The same applies to champions. My most recent experience was a cait vs tristana game, where i would hit her with 6 auto attacks and she left with 95% hp, while she hit me 2 times and i walked away with &lt;25% hp. This was early game so there was no meaningful difference in abilities or items. No traps or nets were used in this engagement, only auto attacks.

Everyone keeps calling it a skill issue because its a toxic community, but when dumping 1400 damage into an adc with miss fortunes ultimate, hitting the whole thing, and the adc walking away with most of its hp, it is hardly a skill issue anymore. In games with identical item sets, levels and game times that kind of attack would completely kill the same adc. I also want to stress that the times this has happened, the adc in question always has less hp at the time than the total damage dealt by the ultimate.

&amp;#x200B;

The same thing also happens when playing master yi, where randomly my attacks will do 5x as much damage as normal, and some games they do practically nothing. I have looked into every single stat i can think of. From armor, magic resist, life steal, weird items, runes, dragon buffs etc. No matter how much i look i see no meaningful difference in characters, builds or all of the above that would explain these experiences. I hope that some of you have gone through something similar so i can finally figure this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, i wish to note this applies to everyone in my lobby. We are a 3 stack, and we all consistently experience this difference in damage output and enemy damage negation (always at the same time in the same matches). I assume many more out there have this issue and it is being attributed to a ""skill issue"" despite no change in playstyle nor build on either team.

Edit:  
Don't bother commenting if you have not experienced it. If you have nothing to add you are just taking up space. The reason for this is that this thread is not about people screaming at eachother, but rather to see if it is a widespread issue. If toxic people spam toxic comments it will drown out the meaningful content. I addressed the usual responses above so no comments repeating the same thing are needed, as the point have been made alredy.

Edit Edit:  
This is not about getting a rank. Its about consistent gameplay even in blind pick.

I want to stress as it's been mentioned in the comments, i am not talking about  Loser's Queue. I have not heard the term used before, but from what i read it is about pairing you with bad teammates.

top,"Hextech Gunblade should be brought back. It just needs to be done. If there are champs that need adjustments due to it, it can be figured out after the fact. What's the worst that's going to happen? OP nonsense in the game? It can be brought back next patch, no need to wait."," Hextech gunblade was in the game for 10+ years. I honestly never heard the community complain about it. Occasionally some would say it made Kat/Akali oppressive, but those champs were top tier for years after the item was removed anyway. Compare it to complaints from stopwatch, banner of command, hullbreaker, stridbreaker+dash active, etc. It was never an item anyone truly had an issue with. It was actually a lot of fun, people loved it. Everyone did.

Arguments against:

1. But it ACUTALLY will make Kat/Akali oppressive. - Shut up, who cares. Figure out how to deal with it.
2. But it gives champs without CC... CC. And \*wiping away drool from chin\* champs with CC...extra CC. - So what, shut up.
3. Sustain is not \*stammering\* S S SUPPOSED TO BE IN THBE GAME ANYMORE - So what, shut up.
4. It will \*loudly breathing and swallows saliva\* throw off the meta - The meta is boring and sucks anyway. So what, shut up.
5. Blah blah blah \[insert any argument against bringing gunblade back next patch\] - Shut up.

Having an extra way to interact and make plays in the game via an item is 100x more fun than solely relying on your champs kit. It allowed for more brain-mode plays, and it has plenty of counterplay still. It's not an auto win item. Think of all the screaming the LCS casters can do when somebody zap kills someone. Think of the pogchamps in LCS twitch chat.

Much of the sustain the game used to have has been removed or mitigated, but I don't see how anyone can possibly find lack of sustain/healing fun. It just means that you have to go back and forth from fountain far more often, and are less able to make plays after a fight or duel. ZZZzzzzz. The heal on the item wasn't overly OP anyway. It allowed you to gradually heal back to full health after \~2 to \~4 full minion waves depending on the point in the game, and sustain a bit in lane. Example: if Kayle is vs malphite, it allows Kayle to somewhat persist in lane rather than permanently losing 1/3HP from one mindless malphite Q and having to back, or getting 1 shot ulted. (\*scoffs loudly\* AH HA HE'S A KAYLE player THAT EXPLAINS WHY HE WANTS IT BACK!!!!!1 - shhhh, be quiet).

There's apparently a trend to pull away a bit from item actives. Wow. That's so fun. Only playing in my little niche while another lane loses and having no agency or carry potential is not fun. Gunblade allows for more playmaking and opportunities to the champions that build it. It's a 3600 gold item, so it's something you have to work for as well.

Just bring it back. If it truly messes stuff up then you can get rid of it again. The game is the most straight up dead and boring grindfest it's ever been. The worst player in the game has too much agency, and matchups have too little counterplay. Giving players an item that give people more opportunities and possibilities to carry is better for everyone. Better for me. Better for you. Yes, you. Because everyone can build it. Me, you, your top, your mid, anyone that wants it. I'm going to build one right now in my garage.",detromi,1697628224.0,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17aod2a/hextech_gunblade_should_be_brought_back_it_just/

* new champions/the sheer number of champions.
