Keywords: Human behavior, video games, internet communities
Description: Toxic behavior in competitive video games is a prevalent issue for game companies since it can easily ruin a community and put newcomers off from trying the game. This project will analyze from a multitude of games from different ELO ratings why players were toxic towards another player, whether it be through abusive chats, spam pinging, or intentionally trying to lose the game. 
Intellectual Merit: Most modern companies that manage any type of social network necessarily take steps towards reducing the amount of toxicity and cyber bullying that occurs on their platforms. By analyzing the cause, companies will be able to better tackle this problem which can result in more welcoming and stable communities.
Data Sourcing: The data will be produced from playing games of League of Legends. The data extracted will be game chats, game and individual results, and recordings of the game through the RIOT API which is public. Some data will also be extracted from content creators who's main focus is playing League of Legends. The data will be retrieved, cleaned, and displayed through Python scripts.
